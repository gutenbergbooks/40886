<p><span class="smcap">The</span> present Volume completes <span class="smcap">The History of the
Reformation in Scotland</span>, and includes Book Fifth,
which was published under Knox's name in 1644, but of
which no manuscript copy has been discovered. Separate
title pages are given, along with a Glossary and Index, as
the History forms a distinct portion of the Reformer's
Works; and these two volumes will probably be in the
hands of many Members of the <span class="smcap">Wodrow Society</span> who
may not be inclined to procure the remaining three, or
more probably, four volumes of the series, in the event of
some arrangement being made by which their publication,
as proposed, shall ultimately be secured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span><span class="smcap">After</span> this our dolorous departing from Edinburgh,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the
furye and the raige of the Frenche increassed; for then durst
neither man nor woman that professed Christ Jesus within
that toune be seyn. The housses of the most honest men
war gevin by the Quene to Frenchemen for a parte of thair
reward. The Erle Bothwell, by sound of trumpett, proclaimed
the Erle of Arrane traytour,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> with other dispytefull wourdes:
whiche all was done for the pleasure and by the suggestioun
of the Quene Regent,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> who then thought the battell was won
without farther resistance. Great practising sche maid for
obteaneing of the Castell of Edinburgh. The Frenche maid
thair faggottis, with other preparationis, to assault the said
Castell either by force, or ellis by treassone. But God
wrought so potentlie with the Capitane, the Lord Erskin,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
that tyme, that neither the Quene by flatterye, nor the
Frenche by treassoun prevailled. Advertisementis with all
diligence past to the Duck of Gwise, who then was King of
France (as concerneing power to command)<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, requiring him
then to make expeditioun, yf he desyred the full conquest
of Scotland. Who delayed no tyme, but with a new armye
send away his brother, Marquis Dalbuf, and in his company
the Martikis,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> promissing, that he himself should follow. But
the rychteouse God, who in mercy looketh upon the afflictioun
of those that unfeanedlye sob unto him, fought for us by his
awin out-stretched arme; <span class="sidenote">THE DROWNYNG
OF THE
FRENCHE.</span>for, upon one nycht, upon the
coast of Holand, war drowned of thame aughttein ensenzeis,
so that onlye rested the schip in the whiche war the two
principallis foirsaid, with thair Ladyis; who, violentlie dreven
back agane to Deape,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> war compelled to confesse, That God
fawght for the defence of Scotland.</p>

<p>Frome England returned Robert Melven,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who past in cumpanye
to London with the Secreatarie,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a lytill befoir Christenmesse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
and brought unto us certane Articles to be ansuered, as
by the contract that after was made, more planely shall appeir.
Whairupon the Nobilitie convened at Striveling, and returned
ansuer with diligence. Whairof the Frenche advertisshed,
thei marched to Lynlythqw, spoiled the Duckis house, and
waisted his landis of Kynneill;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and thairefter came to Striveling,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
whair thei remaned certane dayis: (the Duck, the Erles
of Ergyle and Glencarne, with thair freindis, passed to
Glaskow; the Erle of Arrane, and Lord James, past to
Sanctandrois; for charge was gevin to the haill Nobilitie,
Protestantis, to keap thair awin bodyis, till that God should
send thame farther supporte.) The Frenche took purpose
first to assault Fyffe; for at it was thair great indignatioun.
Thair purpose was, to have tacken and fortifyed
the Toune and Abbay, with the Castell of Sanctandrois;
and so thei cam to Culross, after to Dumfermeling, and
then to Bruntyland, whair thei began to forte; but desisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
thairfra, and marched to Kynghorne, upoun the occasioun
as followeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ERLE
OF SUDDERLANDE
SCHOTE</div>

<p>When certane knowledge came to the Erle of Arrane, and
to Lord James, that the Frenche war departed from Striveling,
thei departed also from Sanctandrois, and begane to assemble
thair forces at Cowper, and send thair men of warr to Kinghorne;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
unto whome thair resorted diverse of the coast syd, of
mynd to resist rather at the begynnyng, than when thei had
destroyed a parte of thair townes. But the Lordis had gevin
ane expresse commandiment, that thei should hasard nothing
whill that thei thameselfis war present. And for that purpose
was send unto thame the Lord Ruthven, a man of great experience,
and inferiour to few in stowtnes. In his cumpany
was the Erle of Sudderland,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> send from the Erle of Huntley,
as he alledged, to conforte the Lordis in thair afflictioun;
butt otheris whispered, that his principall commissioun was
unto the Quene Regent. Howsoever it was, he was hurte in
the arme by the schote of ane haquebute; for the men of
warr, and the rascall multitude, perceaving certane boatis of
Frenchemen landing, whiche cam from Leyth, purposed to
stoppe thair landing; and so, nott considering the ennemeis
that approched from Bruntyland, unadvisedlie thei russhed
doune to the Petticurr, (so is that bray be-west Kynghorne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
called,) and at the sea-coast began the skarmissing, butt never
took head to the ennemye that approached by land, till that
the horsemen charged thame upon thair backis, and the hole
bandis cam directlie in thare faces; and so war thei compelled
to geve backis, with the loss of sex or sevin of thair men, and
with the takein of some, amangis whome war twa that professed
Christ Jesus, one named Paule Lambert,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> a Ducheman,
and a Frenche boy, fervent in religioun, and cleane of lyef,
whome, in despyte, thei hanged ower the steaple.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Thou shall
revenge, O Lord, in thy appointed tyme! The caus that in so
great a danger thair was so small a losse, nixt unto the mercyfull
providence of God, was the suddane cuming of the Lord
Ruthven; for evin as our men had gevin backis, he and his
cumpany came to the head of the bray, and did not onlie stay
the Frenche footemen, but also some of ours brack upoun
thair horsemen, and so repulsed thame that thei did no farther
hurte to oure footemen. In that rencontare was the Erle of
Sudderland foirsaid schote in the arme, and was caryed back
to Cowper. The Frenche took Kinghorne, whair they lay, and
wasted the countrey about, alsweall Papistis as Protestantis;
yea, even those that war confidderat with thame, suche as
Seafield, Weames, Balmowto, Balwearry, and otheris,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> ennemyes
to God and traytouris to thair countrey. Of those (we say)
thei spaired not the scheipe, the oxen, the kyne, and horse;
and some say that thair wyffis and doughtaris gatt favouris
of the Frenche soldiouris. And so did God recompense the
Papistis in thair awin bosomes, for, besydis the defoulling of
thair housses, as said is, tuo of thame resavit more damage
then did all the gentilmen that professed the Evangell within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Fyff, the Laird of Grange onlye excepted, whose [house<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>] of
the Grange the Frenche owerthrew by gun pouder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE
CASTEIN
DOUN OF
THE HOUSE
OF THE GRANGE.</div>

<p>The Quene Regent, proude of this victorie, burst furth in
hir blasphemous rayling, and said, "Whair is now Johne Knox
his God? My God is now stronger than his, yea even in
Fyff." Sche posted to hir freindis in France news<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> that
thousandis of the heretickis war slaine, and the rest war fled;
and thairfoir requyred, that some Nobleman of hir freindis
wald cum and tak the glorie of that victorye. Upon that
informatioun was the Martikkis, with tuo schippis, and sum
Captanis and horse, directed to cum to Scotlande; but litill
to thair awin advantage, as we sall after heare.</p>

<div class="sidenote10">JOAN. 6</div>

<p>The Lordis of the Congregatioun, offended at the folisheness
of the rascall multitude, called to thameselfis the men of warr,
and remaned certane dayes at Cowper; unto whome repaired
Johne Knox, and, in our greatest disperatioun, preached unto
us a most comfortable sermon. His text was, "The danger in
whiche the disciplis of Christ Jesus stude quhen thei wer in
the mydest of the sea, and Jesus was upon the mountaine."
His exhortatioun was, "That we sould not faint, but that we
sould still row aganis these contrarius blastis, till that Jesus
Christ sould come; for (said he,) I am as assuredlie persuaded
that God sall delyver us frome the extreme trowbill, as that I
am assured that this is the Evangell of Jesus Christ whiche I
preche unto [you] this day. 'The fourth watche is nocht yet
come;' abyde a lytill: the boit salbe saved, and Peter, whiche

ye may acknawlege his hand, after that your eyes hes seine
his delyverance."</p>

<p>In that sermon he comforted manye. And yit he offended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the Erle of Arrane; for, in his discourse upoun the manifald
assaultis that the Churche of God had sustained, he brocht
for exampille the multitude of strangeris that persewed Jehosaphat
after that he had reformed religioun. He entreted the
fear of the pepill, yea, and of the King himself att the first;
but after, he affirmed, that Jehosaphat was stout, and to declair
his courage in his God, he conforted his pepile and his
souldiouris; he come fourth in the mydest of thame; he spak
lovinglie unto thame. He keipit not himself (said he) inclosed
in his chalmer, but frequented the multitude, and rejoised
thame with his presence and godlie comforte. These, and
the lyik sentences, took the said Erle to be spoken in reproache
of him, because he keipit himself more close and solitary
then many men wald half wisshed.</p>

<p>After these thingis, determinatioun was tacken that the
Erle of Arrane, and Lord James, with the men of warr, and
sum company of horsemen, sould goe to Dyserte, and thair lye
to wait upoun the Frenche, that they distroyed not the sea-cost,
as thei intendit utterlie to have doun. The said Erle,
and Lord James, did as thei war appointed, albeit thair company
was very small; and yet thei did so valiantlie, that it
passed all credabilitie:<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> for twentie and ane dayis thei lay in

thai held the Frenche so busye, that for everie horse thai slew
to the Congregatioun, thai lost foure Frenche souldiouris.</p>

CAPITANE,
WITH HIS

<p>Willyeaume Kirkaldie of Grange, the day efter that his
housse was cassein doun, send in his defiance to Monsieur
D'Osell, and unto the rest, declaring, that to that hour had he
used the Frenche favourablie: He had saved thair lyves, when
that he mycht have suffered thair throttis to have been cuttit;
bot seing thai haid usit him with that rigor, let thame not
luik for that favour in tymes to cum. And unto Monsieur
D'Osell he said, "He knew that he wald not gett him in the
skirmissing, becauis he knew he was bot a cowart; bot it
mycht be that he sould quyte him a commoun ather in Scotland,
or ellis in France." The said Willyeaume Kirkaldie,
and the Maister off Lyndsay, eschaped mony dangeris. The
Maister had his hors slaine under him: the said Willyeaume
was almost betrayed in his hous at Hawyairdis.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> But yet
thei never seased, bot nycht and day thai waitted upon the
Frenche. Thai laid thameselves in a secreit place, with sum
gentilmen befoir the day, to await upoun the Frenche, quho
usit commonlie to isch in companyis, to seik thair pray; and
so cam fourth ane Capitane Battu,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> with his hundreth, and

Lyndsay,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and the said Wilyeaume, suffered, without declaratioun
of thameselfis, or of thair cumpany, till that thai had
thame more than a myle fra Kinghorne, and then begane the
horsmen to brek; whiche perceved, the Frenche altogither
drew to a place callit Glenniss<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> House, and maid for debait:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
sum tuik the housse, and utheris deffended the close and
yaird. The hasard appereth verry unliklie, for oure men had
na thing bot speris, and war compellit to lycht upoun thair
feit. The other war within dykis; and everie man had
culverinis: the schote was feirfull to mony, and dyverse war
hourt, amongis quhome war Robert Hamiltoun,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and David
Kirkaldie, brother to the said Laird, quho both war supposed
to have bein slaine. The said Laird perceving men to faynt,
and begyne to recule, said, "Fy, lett us never leive efter this
day, that we sall recule for Frenche schybaldis;" and so the
Maister of Lyndsay and he burst in at the yett, and so utheris
followed. The Maister struik with his speir at La Battu,
and glansing upoun his harness, for feirceness stamered almost
upoun his kneis. But recovering suddendlie, he fessned
his speir, and bare the Capitaine bakward, who, becauis he
wald not be takein, was slaine, and fyftie of his cumpanie
with hym. Those that war into the house, with sum utheris,
war saved, and [sent] to Dundye to be kept. This mischance
to the Frenche men maid thame to be more circumspect in
scatring abrod into the countrie; and so the poore creaturis gat
sum releive. To fourness thame<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> of victuelis, was appointed

south schoire and Kinghorne, for that purpois. For his waiges
he spoilzied Kinghorne, Kirkaldie, and so muche of Dyserte as
he mycht. For remedy quhairof war appointit tuo schippis
from Dundye: Andro Sandis, a stout and fervent man in the
cause of religioun, was the principall. This same tyme arrived
the Martekis,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> quho, without delay, landit himself, his cofferis,

leiving the rest in the schippis till better oportunitie. But
the said Andro, and his companioun, streicking saill and making
as thai wald cast anker hard besyde thame, burded thame
both, and carried thame to Dundye. In thame war gotten sum
horse, and muche harness, with sum uther triffilis; but of

the distructioun of Sanctandrois and Dundye; and so, upoun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>

(quhiche war seine that morning by us that war upoun the
land, but war not knawin.) Monsieur D'Osell affirmed thame
to be Frenche schippis, and so the souldiouris triumphit, schot
thair volie for salutatioun, and marchit fordward till Kincraige,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
fearing no resistance.</p>

<p>But schorte efter, the Ingliche schippis mett with Capitain

D'Osell, that thai wer Inglissmen, and that thai war the

Thai thameselvis durst nocht stray abrod to seake;
and the Laird of Weymmes cariage, whiche lykwyis was cumming
with fournissing unto thame, was stayit. And thairfoir,
bytymes in the mornyng, thai retired towardis Kinghorne, and
maid more expeditioun in one day in returning, then thai did
in two in marching fordward.</p>

<p>The storme, whiche had continuit neire the space of a

to Striveling, and syne to Leith. Yit in thair retourning thai
lost dyverse; amongis quhome thair was one quhois miserable
end we man rehers. As the Frenche spoilyied the countrye
in thair retourning, one capitaine or soldiour, we cannot tell,
bot he had a reid cloik and a gilt morrion,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> entered upoun a
poore woman, that dwelt in the Whytsyd, and began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
spoyle. The poore woman offered unto him suche breid as
sche had reddy prepared. But he, in no wayis thairwith
content, wald have the meill and a lytill salt beiff whiche
the poore woman had to susteine hir awin lyfe, and the
lyves of hir poore chylderein; neather could tearis, nor

have quhatsoever he mycht carie. The poore woman perceving
him so bent, and that he stoupped doun in hir tub,
for the taking foorth of suche stufe as was within it, first
cowped up his heillis, so that his heid went doun; and thairefter,
outher<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> by hirself, or if ony uther cumpanie come to
help hir, but thair he endit his unhappie lyfe; God so punissing
his crewell hairt, quho could nocht spair a misserable
woman in that extremetie. "Let all suche soldiouris receve
suche rewaird, O Lord, seing that thou art the revenger of
the oppressed."</p>

<p>And now, because that frome this tyme forward, frequent
mentioun will be maid of the comfortable support that we,
in oure greattest extremetie receved, by Goddis providence,
frome oure nychtbouris of Ingland, we think it expedient
simply to declair by quhat instrumentis that mater was

<p>As Jhonne Knox had foirwairned us, by his letteris frome

<p>"As I have no plaisour with long wretting to trouble you,
Rycht Honorable, quhois mynd I knaw to be occupyed with

long preface to conciliat your favouris, quhilk I suppoise I
have allreddy, (howsomer rumouris bruit the contrarie,) as it
becummeth one member of Chrystis body to have of ane uther.
The contentis, thairfoire, of these my presentis sal be absolved
in tuo pointis. In the former, I purpois to discharge, in breve
wordis, my conscience towardis you: and in the uther, somquhat
must I speik in my awin defence, and in defence of that
poore floke, of lait assembled in the most godlie Reformed
Churche and citie of the warld, Geneva. To you, Sir, I say,
that as frome God ye have receavit lyfe, wisdome, honoris, and
this present estait, in the quhilk now ye stand, so aucht you
whollie<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> to employ the same to the advancement of his glorie,
who onlie is the author of lyef, the fountaine of wisdome, and
quho most assuredlie doeth, and will honour and glorifie these,
that, with sempill hairtis, do glorifie him; quhiche, allace,
in tymes past ye have nott doun; bot bein overcum with
comoun iniquitie, ye have followed the warld in the way of
perditioun. For to the suppressing of Christis trew Evangell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to the erecting of idolatrie, and to the schedding of the blood
of Goddis most deare childrein have you, by silence, consented
and subscryvit. This youre most horrible defectioun frome
the treuth knawin, and anis professed, hath God to this day
mercifullie spared; yea, to manis judgement, he hath utterlie
forgottin and pardoned the same. He hath not intreated you
as he hath done utheris, (of lyke knawlege,) quhome in his
anger, (bot yet most justlie, according to thair desertis,) he
did schoirtlie stryk efter thair defectioun. But you (gyltie in
the same offenses) he hath fostered and preserved, as it wer
in his awin bosome, during the tyme of that most miserable
thraldome of that professed ennemie of God, mischeivous
Marie: and now hath he sett you at such liberty, as the furie
of Goddis ennemeis can nott hurt you, except that willinglie
aganis his honour, ye tak pleisour to conspyre with thame.
As the benefeit quhiche ye hath received is greit, so most
Goddis justice requyre of you a thankfull hairt; for seing that
his mercie hath spared you, being trator to his Majestie; seing
farder, that amanges youre ennemeis he hath preserved you;
and, last, seing, although wourthie<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> of hell, he hath promoted

to advance his glorie, that evidentlie it may appeire, that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
vaine ye have nott receved these graces of God; to performance
quhairof, of necessitie it is, that carnall wisdome and
wardly policie, (to the which both, ye are bruitted too muche
inclyned,) gif place to Goddis simple and naked treuth.
Verry love compellit me to say, that except the Spreit of God
purge youre hairt frome that vennum, which your eis have
seine to have bein distructioun till utheris, that ye sall nott
lang escaip the rewaird of dissembleris. Call to mynd quhatt
your earis heard proclamed in the chapell<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>of Sanct James,
quhen this verse of the first Psalme was entreated, "Not so,
O wicked, nott so; bot as the dust which the wind tossed," etc.
And consider, that now ye travaill in the same way which
then thai did occupy; plainlie to speak, now are ye in that
estait and creddit, in the whiche ye sall ather confort the
sorrowfull and afflicted for rychteousness saik, or ellis ye sall
molest and oppugne the Spreit of God speaking in his messingeris.
The confortares of the afflicted for godlines have promise
of confort in thair greatest necessiteis; but the trubleris
of Goddis servandis, (how contemned that ever<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>thai appeir
befoire the warld,) are threatned to leive thair names in execratioun
to the posteriteis following. The examples of the
one and of the uther are nott onlye evident in Scriptures,
bot also have bein laitlie manifested in England. And this
is the conclusioun of that, whiche to youre self, I say, Except
that in the cause of Chrystis Evangell ye be found semple,
sincear, fervent, and unfeaned, ye sall taist of the same copp,
whiche politick headis have drunkein in befoire you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WARST IS NOTT YITT COME.</div>

<p>"The uther poynt concerning my self, and that poore flocke
now dispersed, and (as I heir say) rudelie intreated, is this:
By dyverse messingeris I have requeisted suche previleges as
Turkis comounlie do grant to men of everie natioun; to wit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that fredome sould be granted unto me peceablie to travell
throucht England,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> to the end that with greater expeditioun
I mycht repair towardis my awin countrie, quhilk now beginneth
to thrist for Chrystis treuth. This requeist I thocht
sa reassonable, that almost I had entered the realme without
licence demandit; and yeit I understand that it had bein so
rejected, that the solistaris thairof did hardlie eschaip empresement.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
And some of that flocke I heir to be so extremelie
handled, that those that most cruellie have shed the blood
of Goddis most deare childrein, find this day amangis you
greattar favouris then thei do. Allace, this appereth muche
to repugne to Christiane cheritie; for quhatsoevir hath bein
my offence, this I feare nott to affirme in thair causses, that if
ony whiche have suffered exyle in these most dolorus dayis
of persecutioun, deserve prais and commendatioun, for peace,
concorde, sober and quiet liveing, it is thei. And as for me,
how criminall that ever I be in Goddis presence, for the
multitude of my synnes; yet befoire his justice-seat I have a
testimonie of guid conscience, that sence my first acquentance
with England, willinglie I never offended persone within it,
(except in oppin chayre to reprove that whiche God condemneth)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
can be judged offense. But I have, (say you,) wreittin a
treassonable [booke] aganis the Regiment and Impyre of
Women: If that be my offense, the poore flocke is innocent,
(except suche as this day do fastest cry treasoun:) For, Sir, in
Goddis presence I wreitt, with none in that cumpany did I
consult befoire the finisheing of the same; and, thairfoire,
in Chrystis name, I requyre that the blame may ly upoun me
allone. The wreitting of that Booke I will nott deny, but to
prove it treassonable I think it salbe hard. For, Sir, no more
do I doubt of the treuth of my principall propositioun, then
that I doubt that this was the voce of God whiche first did
pronunce this penaltie aganis woman, "In doloure sall thou
beare thy chyldrein." It is bruitted, that my Booke is or salbe
writtin against. Yf so be, Sir, I greatlie feare that flattereris
sall rather hurte nor mend the mater, which thei wald seame
to mainteine; for, except that my error be plainlie schawin
and confuted be better authoritie then by suche lawis as frome
yeir to yeir may and do change, I dar nott promitt silence in
so wechtie a besines, leist that in so doing, I sall appear to
betray the verretie whiche is not subjected to the mutabilitie
of tyme. And if ony think me ather ennemye to the Persone
or yet to the Regiment of her quhome God hath now promoted,
thei are utterlie deceived of me. For the miraculouse wark
of God, conforting his afflicted by ane infirme veschell, I do
acknawlege, and the power of his most potent hand (raiseing
up quhome best pleiseit his mercie to suppresse such as fecht
aganis his glorie) I will obey, albeit that boyth nature and
Goddis most perfyt ordinance repugne to suche regiment.
Moir plainlie to speik, yf Quene Elizabeth sall confesse, that
the extraordinarie dispensatioun of Goddis great mercie macketh
that lauchfull unto her, whiche boyth nature and Goddis
law do deny to all women, then sall non in England be more
willing to mainteine her lauchfull authoritie then I salbe:
But yf (Goddis wonderouse werk sett asyd) scho ground (as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
God forbid) the justnes of her title upoun consuetude, lawis, or
ordinances of men; then I am assured, that as suche foolishe
presumpcioun doeth heyghlie offend Goddis supreame majesty,
so do I greatlie feare that her ingratitude sall nocht lang lack
punishement. And this in the name of the eternall God, and
of his sone Jesus Chryst, (befoire quhome boyth you and
I sall stand, to mak accomptes of all counsall we geve,) I
requyre you to signifie unto Her Grace in my name; adding,
that onlie humilitie and dejectioun of herself before God salbe
the firmitie and stabilitie of her throne, quhilk I knaw sall be
assulted mo wayis then one. Yf this ye conceill<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>frome Her
Grace, I will mak it patent to the warld that thus far I have
communicated with you, haveing also farther to speik, yf my
weik judgement may be hearde. Allace, Sir, is my offense
(althocht in that tyme, and in that mater, I had writtin ten
bookis) so haineuse that I can nott have licence, by preacheing
of Christ Jesus, to refreshe thoise thrustye saulles whiche long
have laicked the watter of lyffe. No man will I presentlie
accuse; butt I greatlie fear, that the leprouse have no plaisour
to behald thair faces in the cleir glasse. Lett none<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>be

any continuance to remaine in England; but onlye thristis
in passing furthe to my awin native countrie to communicat
with you and sum uther, suche thingis as willinglie I list nott
to committ to paper, neither yet to the knawledge and

that the said Grange, of zeill and faithfull hairt whiche
he bereth to the furtherance of this our great, and, befoire the

unfeaned favorer of Chrystis trew religioun, and of the libertie

To quhatt end we meane to directe oure actiouns? How we

to advance the glorye of Chryst Jesus, the trew preaching of
his evangell<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> within this realme; to remove superstitioun, and

those that heirtofoir have cruellie sched the bloode of our
bretherein; and, to our utermest, to meanteine the libertie of
this oure countrye frome the tirranie and thraldome of strangeris,
as God sall assist us. How we [sall] be able to accompleiss
these premisses, is to us unknawin; onlye oure hoip is guid
that He that hes begune this guid wark in us, and hathe, by
his power, to this hour confounded the faces of our adversaries,
will performe the same to his glorie, whiche chieflie we seik
in this oure interpryse. Because we suppoise, that neither
oure present danger, neither yett the weirlyke preparatioun
whiche France maketh aganis us, be hyd frome you nor frome
the Counsall, we omitt that pairt. As tuicheing the assurance
of a perpetuall amity to stand betuix these twa Realmes; as no
earthlie [thing] of us is more desyred, so crave we of God to
mak us instrumentis by whiche this unnaturall debaite, whiche
long hath continued betuix us, may anis be composed, to the
prais of Goddis name, and to the confort of the faithfull in
boyth realmes. And gif youre wisdomes can foirsie and devyse
the meanes and assurances, how the same may be brocht to
passe; perswade youreselfis, not onlye of oure consent and assistance,
but also of oure constancie, as men may promeise, to oure
lyves end; yea, and farther, of a charge and commandement
by us to be left to oure posteritie, that the amity betuix [us],
in God contracted and begun, may be by thame kept inviolat
for ever. And for the revolting frome you to France, whiche
yee seeme to fear and suspect, at thair pleisour, we utterlie
abhor that infidelitie; for now doeth the voyce<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> of God continualie
sound in our earis, 'That suche as profaine the terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>

confederacie, amitie, and leigue, sall nott be lyke the pactions

it for Goddis caus, so will we incall his name for the observatioun

returne to thame; ffor we now perceave and feill the wecht

suche instrumentis<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> as by quhome this realme wes befoire

ony change in Authoritie, neither yeit were we myndit to [do]
any suche thing, till extreme necessitie compelled us thairto:
but seing it is now more than evident, that France, and the
Quene Regent heir, with hir preistis, pretend to nothing bot
the suppressing of Chrystis Evangell, the ruyne of us, and the
subversioun of [this] poore realme; committing oure innocencie
to God, and unto the judgment of all godlie and naturall men,
we are determined to seik the nixt remedie, in whiche we
hairtlie requyre youre counsaill and assistance. And this far
we have interprysit, to mak you participant of oure purpois;
becauis in the said letteris you requyred of the [said] Mr.
Kirkcaldie sum farther assurance then his awin woord of
wreitting, whiche we dout nott bot ye sall schoirtlie receave
frome mo then frome us. We dar nott haistellie mak the whole
assemblie, neither of noblis, neither of barronis, prevy in this
cause, for dangeris that may insew by policie and craft of the
adversaries; youre Wisdomes, we doubt not, will communicat
these onlye, with suche as ye knaw favoraris of such ane
godlie conjunctioun. It should much help in oure opinioun,

<blockquote><p>"As youre Grace's displeisoure aganis me, most injustlie
conceaved, hath bein, and is to my wretched hearte a burdene
greavouse, and almost intollerable; so is the testimony of ane
cleir conscience to me ane stay and uphald, that in disperatioun
I synk nott, how vehement that ever the tentatiouns
appeir. For, in Goddis presence, my conscience beareth me
record, that maliciously, nor of purpoise, I never offended
youre Grace, nor youre realme; and, thairfoir, howsoever I be
judged of man, I am assured to be absolved of him quho only
knaweth the secreitis of hairtis. I can not deny the wreiting
of a booke aganis the usurped Authoritie, and injust Regement
of Women;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> neither [yit] am I myndit to retract or call back
any principall point, or propositioun of the same, till treuth and
verritie do farder appeir. But quhy, that either youre Grace,
either yitt ony suche as unfeanedlie favore the libertie of
England, be offendit at the authore of suche ane warke, I can
perceave no just occasioun. For, first, my booke tueched nott
youre Grace's persoune [in speciall,] neither yitt is it prejudiciall
till any libertie of the realme, gif the tyme of my wretting
be indifferentlie considdered. How could I be ennemy
to youre Grace's persone, for delyverance quhairof I did more
studie, and interpryse farther, then ony of these that now
accuise me? And, as concerning youre Regiment, how could or
can I invy that whiche most I have thristit, and for the
quhilk (as oblivioun will suffer) I render thankis unfeandlie
unto God? That is, 'That he hath pleised him, of his eternall
goodness, to exalt your head, (which some tymes was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
danger,) to the manifestatioun of his glorie, and extirpatioun
of idolatrie.' And as for my offense, quhilk I have committed
against England, either in wreitting that, or of any uther
werk, I will nott refuise that moderat and indifferent man
judge and discerne betwix me and those that accuise [me]: to
witt, quhither of the parties do maist hurt to the libertie of
England, I that affirme, 'That no woman may be exalted above
any<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> realme, to mak the libertie of the same thrall to ane
strange, proude, and cruell natioun;' or, they that approve
quhatsoever plaeseth Princes for the tyme. Gif I war alsweill
disposed to accuse, as some of thame (till thair awin schame)
have declaired thame selfis, I no thing doubt, bot that in few
wourdis I sould lett reassonable men understand, that some
that this day lawlie crouche to your Grace, and laubor to mak
me odiuss in your eyes, did, in your adversitie, neather schaw
thame selfis faithfull freindis to your Grace, neather so loveing
and carefull over thair awin native countrey, as thei wald be
estemed. But omitting the accusatioun of utheris, for my
awin purgatioun, and your Grace's satisfactioun, I say, that
nothing in my booke contained, is, nor can be prejudiciall to
your Grace's just regiment, providit that ye be nott found ungrate
unto God: Ungrate ye sallbe provein in presence of
his throne, (howsoever that flattereris justifie your factioun,)
gif ye transferr the glorye of that honor, in quhilk ye now
stand, to any uther thing, then to the dispensatioun of his
mercie, which only maketh that lauchfull to your Grace, quhilk
nature and law denyeth to all woman. Neither wald I that
your Grace should feare that this your humiliatioun before
[God] sould, in ony caise, infirme or weaken your Grace's just
and lauchfull authoritie befoire men. Nay, Madame, such
unfeaned confessioun of Goddis benifits receaved shalbe the
establissement of the same, nott only to youre self, but also to
youre seid and posteritie; whair, contrariwyse, a proude conceat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and elevatioun of youre self, salbe the occasioun, that
youre reigne salbe unstable, troublesome, and schorte. God is
witnesse, that unfeanedlie I boyth love and reverence youre
Grace; yea, I pray, that youre reigne may be long, prosperouse,
and quyet; and that, for the quyetnes which Christis membres,
befoire persecuted, have receaved under you.</p>

<p>"Bot yett, gif I should flatter youre Grace, I war no friend,
bot ane deceavable traitor. And thairfoire of conscience, I
am compelled to say, that neather the consent of people,
the process of tyme, nor multitude of men, can establische a
law which God sall approve; bot quhatsoever he approveth
by his eternall wourd, that shalbe approved, and quhatsoever
he condempneth salbe condempned, thocht all men in earth
wald hasard the justificatioun of the same. And, thairfoire,
Madame, the only way to reteane and kept those benefites of
God, aboundantlie poured now of laitt dayis upoun you, and
upoun youre realme, is unfeanedlie to rander unto God, to
his mercie, and undeserved grace, the [whole] glorie of this
youre exaltatioun. Forgett youre birth, and all tytill which
thairupoun doeth hing; and considder deiplie, how for feir
of your lyef, ye did declyne from God, and bow till idollatrie.
Lett it not appeire ane small offence in your eyes, that ye have
declyned from Christ Jesus in the day of his batteill. Neither
yett wald I, that ye sould esteme that mercie to be vulgare
and commoun which ye have received; to witt, that God hath
covered your former offense, hathe preserved you quhen ye
war most unthankfull; and in the end, hath exalted and raiseit
you up, nott only from the dust, bot also from the portis
of deith, to reule above his people, for the confort of his Kirk.
It apperteneth to you, thairfoire, to ground the justice of your
Authoritie, nott upoun that law, which from year to year
doeth change, but upoun the eternall providence of Him, who,
contrair to nature, and without your deserving, hath thus
exalted your head. Gif thus, in Goddis presence, ye humill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
your self, as in my heart I glorifie God for that rest granted
to his afflicted flocke within Ingland, under you a weik instrument;
so will I with toung and penn justifie your Authoritie
and Regiment, as the Holy Ghost hath justified<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> the same in
Debora, that blissed mother in Israell. Bot gif the premisses
(as God forbeid) neglected, ye sall begin to bragg of your
birth, and to builde your Authoritie and Regiment upoun your
awin law, flatter you quho so list, your felicitie salbe schorte.
Interpreit my rude wordis in the best pairte, as written by
him who is no ennemye to your Grace.</p>

<p>"By dyverse letteris I have requyred license to veseit your
Realme, nott to seik my self, neither yett my awin ease nor
commoditie; which, gif ye now refuise and deny, I most remit
my caus to God; adding this for conclusioun, that commonlie
it is seine, 'That such as refuise the counsaill of the faithfull,

<p>"Two causes impeded me, Richt Worschipfull, to visite
you at any pairt of England. Formar, no significatioun of your
mynd and plaisour was maid unto me, for only did Sir Harye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Percye<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> will me to cum and speak him, which, convenientlie
at that tyme I could nott do, be reasone that the Frenche
men, (which was the Secound cause of my stay,) did then
most furiouslie persew us, whill our company was dispersed;
and then durst I nott be absent for dyverse inconvenientis.
Neather did I think my presence greatlie necessarie with
you, considdering that the mater, which I desyred maist, was
opened and proponed. To the quhilk I wald have wished that
a more plaine and especiall answer should have bein maid.
For, albeit Mr. Quhitlaw, by his credite, Mr. Kirkcaldie, by
his letter, and I, boyth by letteris, and by that which I
had ressaved from Sir James Croftis, did persuade your
goode mindis; yitt could not the Counsall be uthairwayis persuaded,
but that this alteratioun in France had altered your
former purpois. It is nott unknawin what favor we three do
beare to England; and, thairfoir, I wishe, that rather your
pen then our credite, or ony thing writtin to ony of us,
should assuire the Lordis and otheris, of your goode myndis,
(who ar bot now in nomber fyve hundreth). Onless that
money be fournissed without delay to pay the soldiouris with,
for thair servise bypast, and to reteane ane uther thousand
footmen, with three hundreth horsmen, till some stay be had
in this danger, these gentilmen will be compelled to leave the
feildis. I am assured, as fleshe may be of fleshe, that some of
thame will tak a verry harde lyve befoir that ever they compone
eather with the Quene Regent, eather yitt with France;
but this I dar nott promeise of all, onless in you they see a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
greatter fordwardness. To support us will appeir excessive,
and to break promeisse with France, will appeir dangeruss.
But the loss of expensses, in my opinioun, aucht nott to be
esteamit from the first payment; neather yitt the danger
from the first appearance. France is most fervent to conqueise
us, and avoweth, that against us thei will spend thair Croune,
(so did my awin earis heare Buttencourt brag<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>). But, most
assuredlie I knaw, that onless by us thei thocht to mak ane
enteress to you, that thei wald nott bye oure povertie at that
price. Thei labour to corrupt some of oure great men by
money, (and some of oure nomber ar poore, as befoire I wraitt,
and can nott serve without supporte); some thei threattin;
and against utheris thei have raised up ane partie in thair
awin countrey. In this meane tyme, gif ye lye by as neutrallis,
quhat wilbe the end, ye may easellie conjecture.
And, thairfoire, Sir, in the bowellis of Christ Jesus, I requyre
you to mak plaine answer; What the gentillmen heir may
lippin to, and quhatt the Quenis Majestie will do, may without
long delay be put in executioun. Rest in Christ Jesus.

directed from the Lordis to Berwik, Maister Henrye Balnaves,
a man [of] goode credit in boyth the realmes, who suddenlie
returned with such a somme of money as served all the publict
effaris till November nixt; when Jhonne Cokburne of Ormistoun

<p>In the Secound Booke preceading, we have declaired how
Secretarye Lethingtoun<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> was directed to England: but one
thing we have befoire past by. In that, oure greatest dejectioun,
this ordour was tackin, That the Duike his Grace,
the Erlle of Glencarne, Lord Boyd, Lord Uchiltrie, and thair
freindis, should remain togither at Glaskow, for conforte of
the countrey, and for geving of answeris, as occasioun should
requyre; and that the Erlle of Arrane, the Lord James, the
Erlle of Rothess, the Maister of Lyndsay, and thair adherantes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
should continew togither within Fyffe, for the same causses,
that advertissementis mycht go frome the one to the other, as
neid requyred. In the negotiatioun of the Secretary Lethingtoun
with the Quene and Counsall of England, (in whiche he
travailed with no less wisdome and faithfulnes then happy
successe,) mony thingis occurred that requyred the resolutioun
of the hole Lordis,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> amanges which thair was one quhairof
befoir no mentioun is maid.</p>

<p>Efter that the Quene and Counsall of England had concluded
to send thair army into Scotland, for expelling of the
Frenche, the Duke of Northfolk was sent to Berwyk,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> with full
instructionis, power, and commissioun, to do in all thingis concerning
the present effaris of Scotland, as mycht the Quene

said Duke requyred sicke a pairt of the Lordis of Scotland, as
had power and commissioun from the whole, to meet him at
suche day and place as pleised thame to appoint. This advertissement
came first to Glaskow, by the meanis of the Maister
of Maxwell. Quhilk redd and considdered by the Lordis, conclusioun
was takin, that thei wald meitt at Carleill;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and
that was the procurement of the said Maister of Maxwell, for
his ease. Heirupoune war letteris direct fra the Lordis, lyeing
in Glaskow, to Lord James, requyring him, with all possible
expeditioun, to repair towardis thame for the purpois foirsaid.
Which letteris redd and advised upoun, commandment was
gevin to Jhone Knox to mak the answer: For so it was appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
at the devisioun of the Lordis, that he should answer
for the pairte of thoise that war in Fyffe; and Maister Henrye
Balnaves for the pairte of thame that abaide at Glaskow.
The said Jhone answered as followis:&mdash;</p>

"<span class="smcap">To the Lord Duke his Grace, and the Lordis

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">After</span> humill commendatioun of my service. Albeit I
have writtin ofter then anes to Mr. Henrye Balnaves, what

quho long have awaited for youre answer, mycht have bein
satisfied;&mdash;Albeit, (I say,) that of thoise thingis I have befoire
complained, yet of verry conscience, I am compelled to signifie
unto youre Honoris, that onless of these, and other inormiteis,
I sall espye some redress, I am assured that the end shalbe
suche as godlie men shall murne, that ane good cause shall
perishe for lack of wisdome and diligence. In my last letteris
to Mr. Henrye Balnaves, I declared, that youre especiall freindis
in England wounder that no gritter expeditioun is maid, the
weycht of the mater being considdered. Gif the falt be in the
Lord Duke, and his freindis, I wrait also, that the greatest loss
should be his and thairs in the end. And now, I can nott
cease, boyth to wonder and lament, that youre hoile Counsall
was so destitute of wisdome and discretioun as to charge this
poore man, the Priour,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> to come to you to Glaskow, and
thairefter to go to Carleill, for suche effearis as ar to be
entreated. Was thair none amangis you, quho did foirsee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
quhat inconvenientis mycht insew his absence frome these
partis? I cease to speake of the dangeris in the ennemy.
Youre freindis have lyen in the Frith now xv. dayis bypast,
(what was thair formar travaill is nott unknawin); thei have
never receaved conforte of any man (him only excepted), more
then thei had lyen upoun the coast of thair mortall ennemye.
Do ye nott considder, that suche a companye sall neide conforte
and provisioun from tyme to tyme? Remove him, and
quho abydeth that cairfullie will travaill in that or any uther
wechty materis in these pairtis? Did ye nott farther considder,
that he had begune to meddle with the gentilmen<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> who
had declaired thameselfis unfreindis heirtofoir; and also that
ordour wald have bein taekin for suche as haif bein neutrall:
now, be reassoun of his absence, the one shall escaip without
admonitioun, and the other shalbe at thair formare libertie?
I am assured that the ennemye sall nott sleip, neather in that
nor in uther effairis, to undermynd you and your hoile caus;
and especiallie to hurte this pairt of the countrey to revenge
thair formare foly. Gif none of these formar causses should
have moved you to have considered that such a journay (at
suche a tyme,) wes nott meet for him, neather yit for thame
that must accompany him; yit discreit men wald have considdered,
that the men that have lyen in thair jackes, and
travailled thair horse continuallie the space of a moneth,
requyreth some longer rest, boyth to thame selfis, but especiallie
to thair horsses, (befoire thei had bein charged to suche
a journey,) then yitt they have had. The Priour may, for
satisfactioun of your unreasonable myndis, interpryse the purposse;
but I am assured, he shall nott be able to have sex
honnest men in all Fyiff to accompany him: And how that
eather standis with youre Honoris, or with his safetie, juge ye
youre selfis. But yitt, wonder it is, that ye did nott considder,
to quhatt paine and fascherie shall ye putt youre freindis of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
England, especiallie the Duke of Northfolke, and his Counsall,
whome ye shall caus travaile the most wearesoum and fasschous
gaitt that is in England. In my opinioun, quhosoever
gaif you that counsall eather laicked rycht judgement in
thingis to be done, or ellis had too much respect to his awin
ease, and too small regaird to the travaill and danger of thair
bretherein. A comoun cause requireth a comoun concurrance,
and that everie man beare his burdein proportionablie.
But prudent and indifferent men espy the contrair in this
caus, especiallie of lait dayis; for the weakest ar maist
greavouslie charged, and to quhome the mater maist belongeth,
and to quhome justlie greatest burthein is dew, ar
exempted in a manor boyth from travaill and expensses. To
speik the mater plainlie, wyse men do wonder what my Lordis
Dukis freindis do meane, that thei ar so slaike and backward
in this caus: In uther actionis, thei have bein judged stout
and fordward; and in this, whiche is the greatest that ever he
or thei had in hand, thei appeir destitut bayth of grace and
of courage. I am nott ignorant, that thei that are most inward
of his counsall ar ennemyes to God, and thairfoire can nott
bot be ennemyes to his cause. But wounder it is, that he
and his uther freindis should nott considder, that the tinsale
of this godlie interpryse, shalbe the routing of thame and
thair posteritie frome this realme. Considdering, my Lordis,
that by Goddis providence ye ar joyned with the Dukis Grace
in this comoun cause, admonishe him plainlie of the danger to
cum: will him to beware of the counsale of those that ar
plainlie infected with superstitioun, with pryde, and with vennome
of particulare proffeit; whiche gif he do not at your
admonitioun, he shall smarte, befoir he beware: and gif
ye cease to putt him in mynd of his deutie, it may be that, for
youre silence, ye shall drynk some portioun of the plague with
him. Tak my plaine speking, as proceeding from him that is
nott youre ennemye, being also unceartaine when I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>

Lord Jesus Christ, assist you with the spreit of wisdome and
fortitude, that to his glorie, and to youre Lordschipis and oure
commoun conforte, ye may performe that thing, which godlie

lay thair armour besyde thame, and, as men without daingear,
fell to the dice and cairtis. And sua, upoun the Pasche Mononday,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
at the verray hour of noon, the Frenche ischeit baith
on horse and fute, and with greit violence, enterit in to the
Yngliss trynscheis, slew and putt to flycht all that was fund
thairin. The watche was negligentlie keipit, and so was the
succourse slow, and lang in cuming; for the Frenche, befoir
that any resistance was made unto thame, approcheit hard to
the greit ordinance. Bot than the horsmen troupit togidder,
and the futemen gat thameselffis in array, and sua repulsit
the Frenche back agane to the toun. Bot the slauchter was
greit: sum sayis it doubill exceidit that quhilk the Frenche
resavit the fyrst day. And this was the frute of thair securitie
and oures, quhilk efter was remeidit; for the Ynglismen
maist wyslie considdering thame selfis not abill to beseige the
toun round about, devysit to mak montis at dyverse quarteris
of it, in the quhilk thay and thair ordinance lay in as gude
strenth as thay did within the toun. The common soldiouris
keipit the trynscheis, and had the said montis for thair saifgaird
and refuge, in case of any greiter persute than thay
war abill to sustene. The patience and stowt curage of the
Englismen, hot principallie of the horsmen, is worthy of all
prayse: for, quhair was it ever hard that aucht thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
(thay never exceidit that number that lay in camp) sould beseige
four thousand of the maist despairit throt-cuttaris that
were to be found in Europe, and lye sua neir unto thame in

horsmen nycht and day keipit watche, and did sa valiantlie
behaif thameselffis, that the Frenche gatt na advantage fra

<p>This Contract and Band came not onlie to the eiris, bot alssua
to the sycht of the Quene Dowager; quhairat sche stormit
nott a little, and said, "The maledictioun of God I gif unto
thame that counsaleit me to persecute the prechearis, and to
refuise the petitiouns of the best pairt of the trew subjects of
this realme. It was said to me, That the Yngliss army could
not ly in Scotland ten dayis; bot now thay [have] lyin near
ane moneth, and ar mair lyk to remane than the first day thay
came." Thay that gaif sick informatioun to the Quene, spak as
wardlie wyise men, and as thingis appeirit to have bene; for
the cuntrey being almaist in all the partis thairof waistit, the
victuallis nixt adjacent to Leith either brocht in to thair provisioun,
or ellis destroyit; the mylnis and uther placeis, as
befoir is said, being cassin doun, it appeirit that the camp
could not have bene furnissit (except it haid bene by thair
awin schippis, and as that could nocht have bene of ony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
lang continewance, sua sould it have bene nathing confortable:)
Bot God confoundit all warldlie wisdome, and
maid his awin benedictioun als evidentlie to appeir as gif in
ane maner he had fed the army from above. For all kind of
victuallis thair was mair aboundante, and of mair easie priceis,
in the camp all the tyme that it lay, efter that aucht dayis
war past, than either thay haid bene in Edinburgh any of the
twa yeires of befoir, or yit hes bene in that toun to this day.
The pepill of Scotland sa mekill abhorrit the tyrrannye of the
Frenche, that thay wald have gevin the substance that thay
had, to have bene ridd of that chargeable burding, quhilk oure
synnis had provockit God to lay upoun us, in geving us in the
handis of ane woman, quhom our Nobilitie in thair fulischnes
sauld unto strangearis, and with hir the libertie of the Realme.
"God, for his greit mercies saik, preserve us yitt from farther
bondage, in the quhilk we ar lyke to fall, gif he provyde not
remedy; for oure Nobilitie will yett remane blynd still, and
will follow hir affectiouns, cum efter quhat sua may." Bot to

war drawin als neir the toun, as thay gudlie mycht. The
greitt campe removit fra Restalrig to the west syde of
the Watter of Leith; and sa war the cannounis plantit for the
batterie, and did schute at the south-west wall. But be reassone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
all was eird, the brek<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> was nott maid sa greit upoun the
day bot that it was sufficientlie repairit upoun the nycht.
Quhairof the Inglismen begynning to weary, determinit to
gyve the brusche and assault; as that thay did upoun the
sevint day of Maij, beginning befoir the day-licht, and contineuing
till it was neir sevin houris. And albeit that the
Ingliss and Scottis, with greit slauchter of the suldiouris of
baith, were repulsit, yitt was thair never ane scharpar assault
gevin of so few handis; for thay exceidit not ane thousand
men that assaultit the haill twa quarteris of the toun, and
yitt thay dampnit the haill blok-housses; yea, thay anis pat
the Frenche clene of thair wallis, and were upoun baith the
west and eist blokhousses. Bot thay wantit baking; for thair
ledderis wantit sax quarteris of the just hicht; and sua quhill
the former wer compellit to fecht upoun the tope of [the]
wall, thair fellowis could nott win to support thame, and sa
war thay be multitude dung back agane, quhen it was anis
thocht the Toune was win.</p>

<p>Sir James Croftis<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> was blamit of mony for not doing his
dewitie that day; for he was appoyntit, with ane sufficient
nomber of the maist abill men, to haif assaultit the north-west
quarter upoun the sey-syde, quhair, at an low-water
(as at the tyme of the assault) [the passage] was easy:<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
bot neather he nor his approchit to thair quarter appoyntit.

Edinburgh. Quhidder sche had enchantit him we knew nott,
but by suspitioun of that day, in the quhilk he desaivit the
expectation of many, and, sa far as man could judge, was the
caus of that greit repulse; for sum ascribit the schortnes of
the ledderis to him: bot that omittit, quhilk mycht have
proceidit of negligence, his absens frome the persute of his
quarter, was the cause that sick Frenche as war appointit
thair to defend, seing na persewar, came to the releif of thair
fellowis, and sa the twa joyning togidder, with greit slauchter
gaif the repulse to oure company. The Frenche menis harlotis,
of quhom the maist pairt war Scottis hureis, did na less
creweltie than did the souldiaris; for besydis that thay
chargeit thair peceis, and ministrit unto thame uther weaponis,
sum continewallie cast staneis, sum careit chymnayis
of burnyng fyre, sum brocht tymmer and uther impedimentis
of wecht, quhilk with great violence thay threw over the
wall upoun oure men, bot especiallie quhen thay began to
turne backis. Now, albeit in all this we acknawlege the secreit
wark of God, quha by sick meanis wald beat doun alsweill
the pryde of Ingland as of Scotland, yitt neather aucht
the febilnes nor falsett of man to be excusit, neather yitt the
cruelty of the adversareis be conceilit. The Quene Regent
satt all the tyme of the assault (quhilk was baith terribill and
lang) upon the foir-wall of the Castell of Edinburgh; and
quhen sche perceivit the overthraw of us, and that the ensenyeis
of the Frenche war agane displayit upoun the wallis,
sche gaif ane gawfe of lauchter, and said, "Now will I go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>

And sa was Freir Black<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> reddy for that purpose, quhom sche

<p>The Frenche, prowd of the victorie, strypeit naikit all the

myrth sche happit and said, "Yonder are the fairest tapestrie
that ever I saw: I wald that the haill feyldis that is betwix
this place and yon, war strowit with the same stuiffe." This
fact was sene of all, and hir wordis war hard of sum, and
mislykeit of many. Against the quhilk Johnne Knox spak oppinlie
in pulpeit, and baldlie affirmeit, "That God sould reveange
that contumelye done to his image, not onlie in the
furiouse and godless souldiaris, bot evin in sick as rejoysit thairat."
And the verray experience declairit, that he was nott
deceavit; for within few dayis thair efter, (yea sum say that
same day,) began hir bellie and lothsome leggis to swell, and
sa continewit, till that God did execute his judgementis upoun
hir, as efter we sall heir.</p>

<p>The defait receavit, it was fully perswadit to the Queen
Regent and hir factioun, that the Seige wald ryse, and that
the Ingliss army wald depairt: and sua began the Papistis
wondrouslie to brag; and yitt God did frustratt thair expectation;
for the army concludit<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> to remane till new adverteisment

<div class="sidenote">THE COMFORTABLE

<p>The Duck of Northfolk, quha than lay at Berwick, commandit
the Lord Gray to continew the seige, and promeisit
"That he sould not laick men sa lang as ony war to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>

He farther promeisit his awin presens, in caise he sould
be requyreit; and for assurance thairof, he send his awin
palzeounis,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> sic as seldome befoir had bene sene in Scotland,
with his officiaris and provisioun. And with expeditioun
war send twa thousand fresche men, quhairby the
campe, greitlie confortit, began to forgett the former disconfiture,
and to sustene the daylie skyrmissing as thay did befoir;
in the quhilk the Frenche, efter the day of the assault,
did ever resaif the hurt and the repulse, as the slauchter of
many that came to the cockill-raik<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> did witnesse. The
greatest damage that ather Ingliss or Scottis receavit efter
that day, was the slauchter of twa gentilmen, the ane Master
of Househald to my Lord James, Robert Colvene of Cleysche,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
ane man stowt, modest, and wise; quha was schot in the
thigh with ane falcone or haquebute of crock, and depairtit
the miserie of this lyfe within twa houris efter. The uther
was Alexander Lockart, brother to the Laird of Barr,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> quha
raschelie discovering him selff in the trynschis, was schot in
the heid, and immediatlie thairefter depairtit this lyff.</p>

<p>Quhill the seige thus continewit, ane suddane fyre chanceit
in Leith, quhilk devourit many housses and mekill victuall;
and sa began God to fecht for us, as the Lord Erskin in plane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
wordis said to the Quene Regent: "Madam, (quod he,) I can se
na mair, but seing that men may not expell injust possessouris
furth of this land, God him self will do it; for yon fyre is
nocht kindellit be man." Quhilk words offendit the Quene
Regent not a littill; quhais seiknes daylie increassing, greit
craft sche usit that Monsieur D'Osell mycht have bene permitit
to have spokin with hir; belyke sche wald have biddin
him fairweill (for auld familiaritie was greit); bot that denyit,
sche wrait as it [had] bene to hir chyrurgian and apothecar,
schawing hir seiknes, and requyreing sum droggis. The letter
being presentit to the Lord Gray, he espyit the craft; for few
lyneis being writtin above and sa mekill quhyte paper left, he
said, "Drogis ar aboundand and freschear in Edinburgh than
thay can be in Leith: thair lurkis heir sum uther misterie."
And sa he began to try; and be halding the paper to the fyre,
he persavit sum writting [to] appeir, and sa began he to reid.
Bot quhat it was, na uther man can tell; for immediatelie he
brunt the bill, and said to the messinger, "Albeit I have bene

speik hir, bot nocht altogidder, leist that sum pairt of the
Guysianis practise had lurkit under the cullour of [sik] freindscheip.
Hir regrait was unto thame all, "That sche haid behavit
hir self sa fulischlie, that sche had compellit thame to seik
the support of otheris than of thair awin Soverane; and said,
that sche soir repentit that ever it came to that extremitie.
Bot sche was nocht the wyte, bot the wickit counsell of hir
freyndis on the ane pairt, and the Erle of Huntley upoun the
uther; for gif he had nocht bene, sche wald have fully aggreit
with thame at thair communyng at Prestoun." Thay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
gave unto hir baith the counsale and the confort quhilk thai
could in that extremitie, and willit her to send for sum godlie
learnit man, of quhom sche mycht resaif instructioun; for these
ignorant Papistis that war about hir, understude nathing of
the mysterie of oure Redemptioun. Upoun thair motyve was
Johnne Willock send for, with quhom sche talkit ane reassonabill
space, and quha did planelie schaw unto hir, alsweill the
vertew and strenth of the death of Jesus Christ, as the vanitie
and abominatioun of that idole the Mess. Sche did oppinlie
confesse "That thair was na salvatioun, bot in and by the death
of Jesus Christ." Bot of the Mess we hard not hir confessioun.
Sum said sche was annoyntit of the Papisticall maner, quhilk
was ane sygne of small knawledge of the treuth, and of less
repentance of hir former superstitioun. Yitt quhowsoever it
was, Christ Jesus got na small victorie over sick an ennemy.
For albeit before sche had avowit, that in dyspite of all Scotland,
the preachearis of Jesus Christ sould ather die or be
banischeid the realme; yitt was sche compellit not onlie to
heir that Chryst Jesus was precheit, and all idolatrie oppinlie
rebuikit, and in many placeis suppressit, bot alssua sche was
constraineit to heir ane of the principall ministeris within the
realme, and to approve the cheif heid of oure religioun,
quhairin we dissent frome all Papistis and Papistrie. Schort
thairefter sche fynischeit hir unhappy lyfe; unhappy, we say,
to Scotland, fra the fyrst day sche enterit into it, unto the day
sche depairtit this lyfe, quhilk was the nynt of June,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> the zeir

<p>At the samyn tyme of Parliament, Johne Knox taught
publicklie the propheit Haggeus. The doctrin was proper for
the tyme; in applicatioun quhairof he was so speciall and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
vehement, that sum (having greater respect to the warld than
to Goddis glory,) feilling thair selffis prickit, said in mockage,
"We mon now forget our selffis, and beir the barrow to buyld

feir that he shall have experience that the buylding of his
awin house (the house of God being despisit) sall not be so
prosperouse, and of sick firmitie, as we desyre it were. And
albeit sum mockit, yitt utheris were godlie movit, quha did
assembill thame selffis togidder to consult quhat thyngis were
to be proponit to that present Parliament, and efter deliberatioun,
was this subsequent Supplicatioun offerit:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">The Barronis, Gentilmen, Burgesses, and utheris, trew
subjectis of this Realme, professing the Lord Jesus
Chryst within the samyn: To the Nobilitie and
Estaitis of Parliament, presentlie assemblit within
the said Realme, desyre grace, mercy, and peace,
frome God the Father of our Lord Jesus Chryst,
with the incress of His Holy Spreit:</span></p>

<p>PLEIS youre Honouris to reduce to remembrance, how
dyverse and sundrie tymeis we (with sum of youre selffis)
maist humbillie suitit at the feit of the lait Quene Regent
fredome and libertie of conscience, with a godlie reformatioun
of abuseis, quhilk by the malice of Sathane and negligence of
men, are cropin in Religioun of God, and are menteynit by sick
as tak upoun thame the name of Clergye. And albeit that
oure godlie and maist reassonable suyte was then disdainfullie
rejectit, quhairof na small trubillis have ensewit, as your
Honouris weill knaw, yit seing that the same necessitie yit
remaneis that then movit us, and, mairover, that God of his
mercie has now put into your handis to tak sic ordour as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
God thairby may be glorifeit, this communwelth quietit, and
the policie thairof establischeit: We can not cease to crave
of youre handis the redress of sick enormiteis, as manifestlie
are (and of lang tyme have bene) committit be the placehalderis
of the Ministerie, and utheris of the Clergy within
this Realm.</p>

<p>And <i>First</i>, Seing that God of his greit mercy by the lycht
of his word, has manifestit to no small number of this
Realme, that the doctrin of the Roman Kyrk, resaveit be the
said Clergy, and menteynit throu thair tyrannie by fyre and
sword, conteinit in the self many pestiferous errouris, quhilk
can not but bring dampnatioun to the saullis of sick as thairwith
sall be infectit; sick as are the doctrine of Transsubstantiatioun;
of the Adoratioun of Chryst his body under the
forme of breid, as thay term it; of the mereitis of Warkis,
and Justificatioun that thay allege cumis thairby; togidder
with the doctrin of the Papisticall Indulgencis, Purgatorie,
Pilgrimage, and Praying to Sanctis depairtit; quhilk all
either repugne to the plane Scripturis, or ellis have no ground
of the doctrine of our Maister Jesus Christ, his Propheitis, nor
Appostillis. We humbillie thairfoir crave of your Honouris,
that sick doctrine and idolatrie as by Goddis word are condempnit,
so may thay be abolischeit be Act of this present
Parliament, and punischement appointit for the transgressouris.</p>

<p><i>Secundlie</i>, Seing that the Sacramentis of Jesus Chryst are
maist schamefullie abusit and prophanit by that Romane
harlot and hir sworne vassallis; and alssua because that the
treu disciplyne of the ancient Kirk is utterlie now amangis
that sect extinguischeit: for quha within the Realme are mair
corrupt of lyff and maneris than are thay that are callit the
Clergye, living in huredome, adultery, defloring virgeinis, corrupting
matronis, and doing all abominatioun, without feir of
punischement; We humbillie thairfoir desyre youre Honouris
to fynd remedy against the ane and the uther.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span><i>Thirdlie</i>, Because that Man of Syn often maist falslie clames
to him self the titillis of "The Vicare of Chryst; the successour
of Peter; the heid of the Kirk; that he can not err; that all
power is grantit unto him," &amp;c., by the quhilk usurpit authoratie,
he taikis upoun him the distributioun and possessioun of
the haill patrimony of the Kirk, quhairby the trew Ministeris
of the word of God lang tyme hes bene altogidder neglectit,
the godlie learning dispysit, the sculeis not providit, and the
poore not onlie defraudit of thair portioun, but alssua tyrannouslie
oppressit; We lykwise heirof desyre remedy.</p>

<p>And least that your Honouris sould dowt of any of thir premisses,
we offer oure selfis evidentlie to prove, that in all the
[rabill of the] Clergye thair is not ane lauchfull minister, gif
Godis word, the practise of the Apostillis, and thair awin
ancient Lawis, sall judge of lauchfull electioun. We farther
offer oure selfis to prove thame all thevis and murtheraris,
yea, rebellis and tratouris to the lauchfull authoritie of Empriouris,
Kyngis, and Prenceis; and thairfor unworthy to be
sufferrit in any Reformeit Commonwealth. Quhow malitiouslie
thay have murtherit oure brethren, for na uther cause,
bot for that thay offerrit to us the licht of Godis word, your
Honouris can not be ignorant; and in quhat hasard thair
tyrranie hes brocht this haill Realme, the ages after will considder.
Gif ye luik of thame any uther fruit in tymeis cuming,
than ye have sene in thame quham we accuse, we ar
assurit ye sall be desavit. Now hes God, beyond all expectatioun
of man, maid youre selfis, quha sum tymeis war suppliantis
with us for Reformatioun, jugeis, as it war, in the
caus of God. At least he hes subdewit your ennemeis unto
you, that by violence thay ar nocht abill to suppress the
veritie, as heirtofoir thay haif done.</p>

<p>We thairfoir, in the bowellis of Jesus Chryst, crave of your
Honouris, that ather thay be compellit to answer to our former
accusationis, and to sick uthiris as we justlie have to lay to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
thair chargeis, or ellis that, all affectioun laid asyde, ye pronunce
thame be censement of this Parliament sick, and cause
thame to be sua reputit, as by us maist justlie thay ar accusit;
especiallie, that thay be decernit unworthy of honour, authoritie,
charge, or cure within the Kyrk of God, and sa from
hencefurth never to joy vote<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> in Parliament. Quhilk gif ye do
not, than in the feir of God, and by the assurance of his word,
We foirwairne you, that as ye haif ane grevouse yock, and ane
burding intollerabill upoun the kyrk of God within this
Realme, so sall thay be thornis in youre eyes, and pryckis
in your sydis, quhom efter, quhen ye wold, ye sall have no
power to remove. God the Father of our Lord Jesus Chryst
give yow upricht hartis, seiking his glory; and trew understanding
quhat this day he quha delyverit yow fra bondage,
baith spirituall and temporall, cravis of yow by his servandis:
And youre Honouris Answer maist humbly we requyre.</p></blockquote>

<p>This oure Supplicatioun being red in audience of the haill
assembly, dyverse men war of dyverse jugementis; for als sone
thair war that uprichtlie favourit the cause of God, sa war
thair many that for warldlie respectis abhorrit ane perfect
Reformatioun, (for how many within Scotland that have the
name of Nobilitie, ar not injust possessouris of the patrimony

his awin operatioun; without whome we should remane for
ever enemyes to God, and ignorant of his Sone, Christ Jesus.
For of nature we ar so dead, so blynd and so perverse, that
neather can we feill when we ar pricked, see the lycht when
it schynes, nor assent to the will of God when it is reveilled;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>

dead, removeth<a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> the darknes from our myndis, and boweth
oure stubburne heartis to the obedience of his blessed will.
And so as we confesse that God the Father created us when
we war not; as his Sone, our Lord Jesus redeamit us when we
war ennemyes to him: so also do we confesse that the Holy
Ghost dois sanctifie and regenerat us, without all respect of
any merite proceading from us, be it befoir, or be it after oure
regeneratioun. To speak this one thing yit in more plane
wordis, as we willinglie spoyle oureselves of all honour and

of oure regeneratioun and sanctificatioun: For of our selves
we ar nott sufficient to think ane good thoght; but he who hes

free will, but the Spreit of the Lord Jesus, who dwelling in
oure heartis be trew faith, bringis furth sick good workis as
God hath prepared for us to walk into: for this we most boldlie
affirm, that blasphemy it is to say, that Christ Jesus abydis
in the heartis of sick as in whome thair is na spreit of Sanctificatioun.
And thairfoir we fear nott to affirme, that murtherraris,
oppressouris, cruell persecutaris, adulteraris, whoremongaris,
filthy personis, idolateris, drounkardis, theavis, and all
workaris of iniquitie, have neather trew faith, neather any
portioun of the spreat of Sanctificatioun, whiche proceadeth
frome the Lord Jesus, so long as thei obstinatlie continew in
thair wickednes. For how sone that ever the spreit of the
Lord Jesus, (whiche Godis elect children resave by trew fayth,)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
takis possessioun in the heart of any man, so soon dois he
regenerat and renew the same man; so that he begynnis to
hate that whiche befoir he luffit, and begynnis to luif that
whiche befoir he hated; and from thence cumis that continewall
battell which is betwix the flesche and the spreit in
Godis children; while the flesche and naturall man (according
to the awin corruptioun) lustis for things pleasing and
delectable unto the self, grudges in adversitie, is lyfted up
in prosperitie, and at everie moment is prone and reddye to
offend the Majestie of God. Bot the Spreit of God, whiche
giveth witnessing till our spreit, that we ar the sones of God,
makis us to resist the devill, to abhorr<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> fylthy pleasouris, to
groane in Godis presence for deliverance from this boundage of
corruptioun; and finally, so triumphe over syne that it reigne
not in our mortall bodyes. This battell hes nott the carnall
men, being destitut of Goddis Spreitt; but do follow and obey
syn with greadynes, and without repentance, evin as the
devill and thair corrupt lustis do prick thame. But the sonnes
of God (as befoir is said) does feght against syn, do sobb and
murne, when they perceave thame selfis tempted to iniquitie;
and gif they fall, they ryse agane with earnest and unfeaned
repentance. And these thingis they do nott by thair awin
power, but the power of the Lord Jesus (without whome thai
war able to do nothing) wyrketh in thame all that is good.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

to esteame the reverent name of God; to prophane, abuse, or

most equall, most holy, and most perfite; commanding those

we have no syn, (evin after we ar regenerat,) we deceive our

as Cain did Abell; Ismaell, Isaac; Esau, Jacob; and the whole
preasthead of the Jewis, Jesus Christ him self, and his apostles
after him; it is a thing most requisite, that the trew Kirk be
discernit frome the filthy synagoge, be cleare and perfite nottis,
least we being deceaved, resave and embrace to our awin condemnatioun
the ane for the other. The nottis, signes, and
assured tokenis whairby the immaculat spouse of Christ Jesus
is knawin from that horrible harlote the Kirk malignant, we
affirme ar neyther antiquitie, title usurped, lineall discente,
place appointed, nor multitude of men approving ane errour;
for Cain in aige and title was preferred to Abell and Seth.
Jerusalem had prerogative above all places of the earth, whair
also war the preastis lineally descended from Aaron; and
greattare multitude<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> followed the Scribes, Pharaseis, and

judgment<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> will grant that any of the foirnamed war the Kirk
of God. The Notis, thairfoir, of the trew Kirk of God we
beleve, confesse, and avow to be, first, The trew preaching of
the word of God; into the whiche God hes reveilled him self to
us, as the writtingis of the Prophettis and Apostles do declair.
Secoundlie, The rycht administratioun of the sacramentis
of Christ Jesus, whiche mun be annexed to the worde
and promisse of God, to seall and confirme the same in our
hartis. Last[ly], Ecclesiasticall discipline uprychtlie ministred,
as Godis word prescribed, whairby vice is repressed, and vertew
nurished. Whairsoever then these former nottis ar sene, and
of any tyme continew (be the number never so few above twa
or thre) thair, but all dowbt, is the trew Kirk of Christ, who
according to his promeise is in the myddis of thame: not
that universal (of whiche we have befoir spokin) but particulare;
sick as was in Corinthus, Galatia, Ephesus, and utheris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
places in whiche the ministerie was planted by Paule, and
war of him self named the Kirkis of God. And sick kirkis,
we, the Inhabitants of the Realme of Scotland, professouris of
Christ Jesus, confesse us to have in our cities, townis, and
places reformed; for the doctrine taught in our kirkis is conteaned
in the writtin word of God, to witt, in the buikis of the
Auld and New Testamentis. In these buikis we meane, whiche
of the ancient have bene reputed canonicall, in the whiche
we affirme that all thingis necessarie to be beleaved for the
salvatioun of mankynd, is sufficientlie expressed; the interpretatioun
whairof, we confess, neather apperteaneth to privat
nor publict persone, neather yit to any kirk for any preheminence
or prerogative, personall or locall, whiche one hes
above another; butt apperteaneth to the Spreit of God, by
the whiche also the Scripture was writtin. When contraversie
then happinneth for the rycht understanding of any place
or sentence of Scripture, or for the reformatioun of any abuse
within the Kirk of God, we aucht not sa mekle to look what
men befoir us have said or done, as unto that whiche the Holy
Ghost uniformelie speakis within the body of the Scriptures,
and unto that whiche Christ Jesus him self did, and commanded
to be done. For this is a thing universallie granted,
that the Spreit of God, which is the Spirit of unitie, is in nothing
contrarious unto himself. Yf then the interpretatioun,
determinatioun, or sentence of any doctour, kirk, or counsall,
repugne to the plane word of God writtin in any other place
of [the] Scripture, it is a thing most certane, that thairis is
nocht the trew understanding and meanyng of the Holy Ghost,
supposing that Counsallis,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Realmes, and Nations have approved

have approved<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> unto us; so without just examinatioun dar we
not resave whatsoever is obtrused unto men, under the name
of Generall Counsallis: for plane it is, that as they war men,
so have some of thame manifestlie erred, and that in materis
of great weght and importance. So far then as the Counsall
proveth the determinatioun and commandiment that it geveth
by the plane word of God, so far do we reverence and embrace
the same. But yf men, under the name of a Counsall
pretend to forge unto us new articles of our faith, or to maik
constitutionis repugnyng to the word of God, then utterlie we
mone refuise the same, as the doctrin of devillis which drawis
our saullis from the voice of our onlie God, to follow the doctrines
and constitutionis of men. The caus, then, why [that]
Generall Counsallis convened, was neather to mak any perpetuall
law (whiche God befoir had nott maid,) neather yitt to
forge new articles of our beleve, neather to give the word of
God authoritie, mekle less to make that to be his worde, or yitt
the trew interpretatioun of the same, which was not befoir by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
his holy will expreassed in his worde. But the caus of Counsallis,
(we meane of sick as merite the name of Counsallis,)
was partlie for confutatioun of heresyes, and for geving publict
confessioun of thair faith to the posteritie following; whiche
baith they did by the authoritie of Goddis writtin worde, and
nott by any opinioun or prerogative that they could nott err, be
reassoun of thair Generall assemblie: And this we judge to
have bene the cheaf caus of Generall Counsallis. The other was
for good policie and ordour to be constitut and observed in the
Kirk, in whiche (as in the house of God) it becumis all thingis
to be done decentlie and into ordour. Not that we think that
ane policie, and ane ordour in Ceremonies can be appointit for
all aigis, tymes, and plaicis; for as ceremonies (sick as men
hes devised) ar but temporall, so may and aucht they to be
changed, when they rather foster superstitioun, then that they
edifie the Kirk using the same.</p>

sacrifices, had two cheaf Sacramentis, to witt, Circumcisioun
and the Passover, the despysaris and contemnaris whairof war
not reputed for Godis people; so [do] we acknawledge and confesse
that we now, in the tyme of the Evangell, have two<a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Sacramentis
onlie, institutit be the Lord Jesus, and commanded
to be used of all those that will be reputed members of his
body, to witt, Baptisme and the Supper, or Table of the Lord
Jesus, called The Communioun of his body and bloode. And
these sacramentis (alsweill of the Auld as of the New Testament)
war institut<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> of God, not onlie to maik ane visible difference

participatioun of the same sacramentis, to seall in thair heartis
the assurance of his promeis, and of that most blessed conjunctioun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
unioun, and societie, whiche the Elect have with
thair head, Christ Jesus. And thus we utterlie dampne the
vanitie of those that affirme Sacramentis to be nothing else
but naked and bair signes. No, we assuredlie beleve, that
by Baptisme we ar ingrafted in Christ Jesus to be maid partakaris
of his justice, by the whiche our synes are covered and
remitted; and also, that in the Supper, rychtlie used, Christ
Jesus is so joyned with us, that he becumis the verray
nurishement and foode of our saullis. Not that we ymagine
any transsubstantiatioun of bread into Christis naturall body,
and of wyne in his naturall bloode, (as the Papistis have perniciouslie
taught and dampnablie beleved;) but this union and
communioun whiche we have with the body and bloode of Christ
Jesus in the rycht use of the sacraments, is wrocht by operatioun
of the Holy Ghost, who by trew faith caryes us above all
thingis that ar visible, carnall, and earthlie, and maikis us to
feid upoun the body and bloode of Christ Jesus, whiche was ones
brokin and schedd for us, whiche now is in the heavin, and appeareth
in the presence of his Father for us. And yit, notwithstanding
the far distance of place, whiche is betwix his bodye
now glorifeid in the heavin, and us now mortall in this earth,
yit we most assuredlie beleve, that the bread which we break is
the communioun of Christis body, and the cupp which we bliss,
is the communion of his bloode. So that we confesse, and undowttedlye
beleve, that the faithfull, in the rycht use of the
Lordis Table, so do eatt the body, and drynk the bloode of the
Lord Jesus, that he remaneth in thame and thai in him: yea,
that thai ar so maid flesche of his flesche, and bone of his
bones, that as the Eternall Godheid hath gevin to the flesche
of Christ Jesus (whiche of the awin conditioun and nature
was mortall and corruptible) lyfe and immortalitie, so doeth
Christ Jesus his flesche and bloode eatten and drunken by us,
give to us the same prerogatives: Whiche albeit we confesse,
are neather gevin unto us at that onlie tyme, neather yit by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the propir power and vertew of the Sacramentis onlie; yit we
affirme, that the faithfull in the rycht use of the Lordis Table
hes sick conjunctioun with Christ Jesus, as the naturall man
can not comprehend: yea, and farther we affirme, that albeit
the faithfull oppressed be negligence, and manlie infirmitie,
doeth not proffeitt so mekill as thei wold att the verray instant
actioun of the Supper, yit shall it after bring furth frute,
as livelie seid sawin in good ground; for the Holy Spreit, whiche
can never be devided frome the rycht institutioun of the Lord
Jesus, will not frustrat the faythfull of the frute of that misticall
actioun. But all this, we say, cumis by trew fayth,
whiche apprehendeth Christ Jesus, who onlie maikis his Sacramentis
effectuall unto us; and, thairfoir, whosoever sclandereth
us, as that we affirmed or beleved Sacramentis to be
onlie naiked and bair signes, do injurie unto us, and speak
against a manifest treuth. But this liberallie and francklie
we most confess, that we maik ane distinctioun betwix Christ
Jesus, in his naturall substance,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> and betwix the elementis in
the Sacramentall signes; so that we will neather wirschip the
signes in place of that which is signifeid by thame; neather
yit do we dispyse and interprete thame as unprofitable and
vane; but do use thame with all reverence, examyning our
selfis diligentlie befoir that so we do, becaus we ar assured
by the mouth of the Apostle, "That sick as eat of that bread,
and drynk of that cupp, unworthelie, ar guyltie of the body
and bloode<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> of the Lord Jesus."</p>

<p>That Sacramentis be rychtlie ministred, we judge twa
thingis requisit: the one, That thei be ministred be lauchfull
ministeris, whome we affirme to be onlie thei that ar appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to the preaching of the worde, or into whose mouthis God hes
putt some sermoun of exhortatioun, thei being men lauchfullie
chosin thairto by some Kirk. The other, That thei be
ministred in sic elementis, and in sic sorte as God hath appointed.
Ellis we affirme, that thei cease to be rycht Sacramentis
of Christ Jesus. And, thairfoir, it is, that we flye the
societie with the Papisticall Kirk, in participatioun of thair
Sacramentis; first, becaus thair ministeris ar no ministeris of
Christ Jesus; yea, (whiche is more horrible) thei suffer wemen,
whome the Holy Ghost will not suffer to teache in the congregatioun,
to Baptise. And, secoundlie, Becaus thei have so
adulterat, both the one sacrament and the other, with thair
awin inventionis, that na pairte of Christis actioun abydeth in
the originall puritie; for oyle, salt, spattle,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> and siclyk in
baptisme, are but menis inventionis; adoratioun, veneratioun,
bearing throcht streittis and townes, and keaping of
bread in boxes or buistis, are prophanatioun of Christis
Sacramentis, and no use of the same: For Christ Jesus
said, "Tak, eat, &amp;c.; Do ye this in remembrance of me." By
which wordis and charge he sanctifeid bread and wyne to be
the sacrament of his body<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> and blude; to the end, that the one
should be eatten, and that all should drink of the other; and
not that thei should be keapt to be wirschiped and honoured
as God, as the blynd Papistis have done heirtofoir, who also
have committed sacriledge, stealling frome the people the one
parte of the Sacrament, to witt, the blissed cupp. Moreover,
that the Sacramentis be rychtlie used, it is requyred, that the
end and caus why the Sacramentis war institut, be understand
and observed, alsweall of the minister as of the receaveris; for
yf the opinioun be changed in the receavare, the rycht use ceasseth;
whiche is most evident by the rejectioun of the sacrifices,
(as also yf the teachar teache<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> fals doctrin,) whiche war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
odiouse and abominable unto God (albeit thei war his awin
ordinances,) becaus that wicked men use thame to ane other
end than God hath ordeaned. The same affirme we of the
sacramentis in the Papisticall Kirk, in whiche we affirme the
haill actioun of the Lord Jesus to be adulterat, alsweill in the
externall forme, as in the end and opinioun. What Christ
Jesus did, and commanded to be done, is evident by the three
Evangelistis [quho speak of the Sacrament,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>] and by Sanct
Paule: What the preast does at his altare we neid not to rehearse.
The end and caus of Christis institutioun, and why the
self same should be used, is expressed in these wordis,&mdash;"Do
this in remembrance of me. As oft as ye shall eatt off this
bread and drynk of this cupp, ye shall schaw furth, (that is,
extoll, preache, and magnifie,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>) the Lordis death till he come."
But to what end, and in what opinioun the preastis say thair
masses, lett the wordis of the same, thair awin doctouris and
writtingis witness, to witt, that thei, as mediatouris betwix
Christ and his Kirk, do offerr unto God the Father ane sacrifice
propitiatorie for the synnes of the quick and the dead.
Which doctrine, as blasphemous to Christ Jesus, and macking
derogatioun to the sufficiencie of his onlie sacrifice, ones offered
for purgatioun of all those that shalbe sanctified, we utterlie
abhorr, detest, and renunce.</p>



<p class="center"><span class="smcap">To Whome Sacramentis Apperteane.&mdash;Cap. xxiii.</span></p>

<p>We Confesse and acknawledge that Baptisme apperteaneth
alsweall to the infantis of the faithfull, as to those that be of
age and discretioun. And so we dampne the errour of [the]
Anabaptistes, who deny baptisme to apperteane to children,
befoir that thei have faith and understanding. But the Supper
of the Lord, we confesse to apperteane onlie to sick as<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
bene of the houshold of faith, [and] can try and examyn
thame selfis, asweill in thair faith, as in thair dewtie towardis
thair nychtbouris. Such as eat [and drink] at that holy table
without fayth, or being at dissentioun and divisioun with thare
brethren, do eat unworthelye: and thairfoir it is, that in our
Kirkis our Ministeris tackis publict and particulare examinatioun
of the knowledge and conversatioun of suche as are to
be admitted to the table of the Lord Jesus.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Of the Civile Magistrat.&mdash;Cap. xxiv.</span></p>

<p>We Confesse and acknawledge impyres, kyngdomes, dominiounis,
and cities to be distincted and ordaned by God: the
powers and authorities in the same (be it of Emperouris in
thair impyris, of Kingis in thair realmes, Dukis and Princes
in thair dominiounis, or of otheris Magistratis in free cities,)
to be Godis holy ordinance, ordeaned for manifestatioun of his
awin glorie, and for the singulare proffeit and commodite of mankynd.
So that whosoever goes about to tack away or to confound
the haill state of civile policies, now lang establisched,
we affirme the same men not onlie to be ennemyes to mankynd,
but also wickedlie to feght against Godis expressed will.
We farther Confesse and acknawledge, that sic personis as are
placed in authoritie are to be loved, honoured, feared, and holdin
in most reverent estimatioun; becaus [that] thei are the
lieutennentis of God, in whose sessioun God him self doeth sitt
and judge, (yea evin the Judges and Princes thame selfis,) to
whome by God is gevin the sweard, to the praise and defence
of good men, and to revenge and puniss all open malefactouris.
Moreover, to Kingis, Princes, Reullaris, and Magistratis, we
affirme that cheiflie and maist principallie the reformatioun<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
and purgatioun of the Religioun apperteanes; so that not
onlie thei are appointed for civile policey, bot also for mantenance
of the trew Religioun, and for suppressing of idolatrie
and superstitioun whatsomever, as in David, Josaphat, Ezechias,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Josias, and otheris, heychtlie commended for thair zeall
in that caise, may be espyed. And thairfoir we confesse and
avow, that sick as resist the Supreme power, (doing that
thing which apperteanis to his charge,) do resist Goddis ordinance,
and thairfoir can not be guyltless. And farther, we
affirme, that whosoever deny unto thame thair aid, counsall,
and conforte, while the Princes and Reullaris vigilantlie
travaill in the executing<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> of thair office, that the same men
deny thair help, supporte, and counsall to God, who by the
presence of his lieutennent craveth it of thame.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Giftis frelie gevin to the Kirk.&mdash;Cap. xxv.</span></p>

<p>Albeit that the word of God trewlie preached, [and] the Sacramentis
rychtlie ministred, and discipline executed according

the trew Kirk; yit do we nott so meane, that everie<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> particulare
persone joyned with sick ane cumpany, be ane elect member
of Christ Jesus. For we acknawledge and confesse, that darnell,
cokle, and chaff, may be sawin, grow, and in great abundance
lye in the myddis of the wheat; that is, the reprobat
may be joyned in the societie of the elect, and may externallie
use with thame the benefites of the word and sacramentis;
but sic being butt temporall professouris in mouth,
but not in heart, do fall back and continew not to the end: and
thairfoir haif thei no fruit of Christis death, resurrectioun, nor
assentioun. But sick as with heart unfeanedlie beleve, and
with mouth boldlie confesse the Lord Jesus, (as befoir we
have said,) shall most assuredly resave these giftis; first, In
this lyfe, remissoun of synnes, and that by faith onlie in
Christis blude, insamekle, that albeit syne remane and continuallie
abyd in these our mortall bodyes, yit it is not imputed
unto us, but is remitted and covered with Christis justice.
Secondlie, In the generall judgement thair shalbe gevin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to everie man and woman resurrectioun of the flesche; for
the sea shall geve hir dead, the earth those that thairin be
inclosed; yea, the Eternall, our God, shall stretche out his
hand upoun the dust, and the dead shall aryse incorruptible,
and that in the substance of the [self] same flesche that everie
man now bearis, to resave, according to thair warkis, glorie or

superstitioun, or idolatrie, shalbe adjudged to the fyre
inextinguishable, in the whiche thei shalbe tormented for ever,
alsweall in thair awin bodyes, as in thair saullis, whiche now
thei give to serve the devill in all abominatioun. Butt sik as
continew in weall doing to the end, boldlie professing the

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> oure <span class="smcap">Confessioun</span> was publictlie red, first in audience
of the Lordis of Articles, and after in audience of the haill
Parliament; whair war present, not onlie suche as professed
Christ Jesus, but also a great number of the adversaries of our
religioun, suche as the foirnamed Bishoppis, and some others
of the Temporall Estate, who war commanded in Goddis
name to object, yf thei could, any thing against that doctrine.
Some of our Ministeris war present, standing upoun thair feit,
reddye to have ansuered, in caise any wald haif defended the
Papistrie, and impugned oure affirmatives: but whill that no
objectioun was maid, thair was a day appointed to voting in
that and other headis. Oure Confessioun was redd, everie
article by itself, over agane, as thei war wryttin in ordour,
and the vottis of everie man war requyred accordinglie. Of
the Temporall Estate onlie voted in the contrair, the Erle of
Atholl,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> the Lordis Somervaill<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and Borthwik;<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> and yit for

will beleve as oure fatheris beleved." The Bischoppis, (Papisticall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
we meane,) spack nothing. The rest of the haill thre
Estaittis, by thair publict votes, affirmed the doctrine; and
many, the rather, becaus that the Bischoppis wold nor durst
say nothing in the contrair; for this was the vote of the Erle
Merschell,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>&mdash;"It is long since I have had some favour unto the
trewth, and since that I have had a suspitioun of the Papisticall
religioun; but, I praise my God, this day hes fully resolved
me in the one and the other. For seing that my Lordis
Bischoppis, who for thair learing can, and for the zeall that
thei should bear to the veritie, wold, as I suppose, ganesay
any thing that directlie repugnes to the veritie of God; seing,
I say, my Lordis Bischoppis heir present speakis nothing in
the contrair of the doctrine proponed, I can nott but hold it
to be the verie trewth of God, and the contrarie to be deceavable
doctrine. And thairfoir, so far as in me lyeth, I approve
the one and dampne the other: And do farther ask of
God, that not onlie I, but also all my posteritie, may enjoy the
comforte of the doctrin that this day our earis have hearde.
And yitt more, I man vote, as it war by way of protestatioun,
that yf any persones ecclesiasticall shall after this oppone
thame selfis to this our Confessioun, that thei have no place
nor credite, considdering that thei having long advisement,
and full knawledge of this oure Confessioun, none is now found
in lauchfull, free, and quyete Parliament to oppone thame
selfis to that whiche we professe: And thairfoir, yf any of
this gencratioun pretend to do it after this, I protest he be

full powar, and neideth nott the suffrage of man, but in so
far as man hath neid to beleve it, yf that ever he shall have
participatioun of the lyfe everlesting. But somewhat most we
answer to suche as since hes whispered, that it was but a pretended
Parliament and a privye conventioun, and no lauchfull
Parliament. Thair reassonis ar, the King and Quene war
in France; thair was neather sceptour, sweard, nor croune
borne, &amp;c., and some principall Lordis war absent. We answer,
That we rather wishe the Papistis to be quyett, nor too
curiouslie to travell in that head; for it may be, that whill
thei think to hurte us, thei tack the Quene and hir authoritie
a great blawe, and yitt amend thame selffis nothing. For in
whose defalt, we pray yow, was the Quene absent frome this
Realme? We think thei will not be so schameless as that
thei will blame the Protestantis thairof. Her persone was absent,
and [that] to no small greaff of our hartis. But war nott
the Estaitis of hir Realme assembled in hir name? Yea, had
thei nott hir full power and commissioun, yea, the commissioun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and commandiment of hir head the King of France, to convocat
that Parliament, and to do all thingis that may be done
in lauchfull Parliament, evin as yf oure Soveranis had bene
thair in proper personis? Yf thei will limitat the power of
princes to the places onlie whair thair bodelye presence is, it
will be thocht strange; for so not onlie shall Kingis be compellit
to content thame with one Realme, but also with one
citie; for the bodilie presence of Kingis can no more be in
diverse cities in one instant, then that thei can be in diverse
Realmes. Hitherto we haif understand, that whairsoever the
Counsallouris of the King, with his power and commissioun, ar
assembled to do any thing at his commandiment, that thair is
the Kingis sufficient presence and authoritie, whairsoever his
awin body be leving at fredome and libertie. Which, yf the
Papistis deny, we will find faultis with thame, and with the
princes whome thei have abused, that more will annoy thame
then anything that we can lose by the insufficiencie of that
Parliament; whiche not the less we ar bold to affirme, to have
bene more lauchfull, and more free then any Parliament that
thei ar able to produce this hundreth year befoir it, or yitt any
that hath ensewed since it was; for in it, the votes of men
war free, and gevin of conscience: in otheris thei war bought
or gevin at the devotioun of the prince. All thingis in it
concluded ar able to abyde the tryall, and nott to be consumed
at the prufe of the fyre. Off otheris the godly may justly
call in dowbt thingis determined.</p>

<p>To the sweard and sceptour, nor yitt to the absence of some
Lordis, we ansuere nothing; for oure adversaries know weall
yneuche that the one is rather a pompe and gloriouse vane
ceremonye, than a substantiall point of necessitie, requyred
to a lauchfull Parliament; and the absence of some prejudges
nott the poweris of the present, providing that dew advertisement
be made unto thame. But now we returne to oure
Historye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span><span class="smcap">The</span> Parliament dissolved, consultatioun was had, how the
Kirk mycht be establissed in a good and godlie Policy, whiche
by the Papistes was altogether defaced. Commissioun and
charge was gevin to Mr. Johne Winram<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Suppriour of Sanctandrois,
Maister Johne Spottiswoode, Johne Willok, Mr. John
Douglas Rectour of Sanctandrois, Maister Johne Row, and
Johne Knox, to draw in a volume the Polecey and Disciplyn of
the Kirk, as weill as thei had done the Doctrin; whiche thei did
and presented to the Nobilitie, who did peruse it many dayis.
Some approved it, and willed the samyn have bene sett furth
be a law. Otheris, perceaving thair carnall libertie and worldlie
commoditie somewhat to be impaired thairby grudged, insomuche
that the name of the Book of Discipline became
odious unto thame. Everie thing that repugned to thair corrupt
affectionis, was termed in thair mockage, "devote imaginationis."
The caus we have befoir declaired; some war licentious;
some had greadelie gripped to the possessionis of the
Kirk; and otheris thought that thei wald nott lack thair
parte of Christis coat; yea, and that befoir that ever he was
hanged, as by the Preachearis thei war oft rebuked. The
cheaf great man that had professed Christ Jesus, and refuissed
to subscrive the Book of Discipline, was the Lord Erskyn;<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
and no wonder, for besydis that he has a verray Jesabell to
his wyffe, yf the poore, the schooles, and the ministerie of the
Kirk had thair awin, his keching wald lack two parttis and
more, of that whiche he injustlie now possesses. Assuredlye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
some of us have woundered how men that professe godlynes
could of so long continewance hear the threatnyngis of God
against theavis and against thair housses, and knowing thame
selfis guyltie in suche thingis, as war openlie rebucked, and that
thei never had remorse of conscience, neather yitt intended
to restore any thingis of that, whiche long thei had stollen and
reft. Thair was none within the Realme more unmercyfull
to the poore Ministeris then war thei whiche had greatest
rentis of the Churches. But in that we have perceaved the
old proverbe to be trew, "Nothing can suffice a wreche;" and
agane, "The bellie hes none earis." Yitt the same Book of Discipline

<p>Schort after the said Parliament, war send from the counsall
Ambassadouris to England, the Erles Mortoun and
Glencarne, togidder with William Maitland of Lethingtoun
youngare. The cheaf poynt of thair commissioun was earnestlie
to crave the constant assistance of the Quenis Majestie
of England, against all forane invasioun, and to propone the
Earle of Arrane (who then was in no small estimatioun with us)
to the Quene of England in mariage.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

that he wold manteane the idolatrie of the Messe, and also
that he besett the way to the Erle of Arrane, with a great
gathering, as he was ryding with his accustumed companye.</p>

<p>The Papistis war proude, for thei looked for ane new armye
from France at the nixt spring, and thairof was thair no small
appearance, yf God had not otherwyse provided. For France
utterlie refused the confirmatioun of the peace contracted at
Leyth, wald ratifie no parte of oure Parliament, dismissed the
Lord of Sanct Johne without any resolute ansure,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> begane to

new trubles within this Realme. And all this came partlie of
the malice of the house of Gwise, who had avowed to revenge
the displeasour of thair sister, boyth upoun England and Scotland,
and partlie by instigatioun of proud Beatoun, falslie
called Bischope of Glasgu, of Dury, Abbot of Dumfermeling,

<p>The certane knowledge of all these thingis came to our
earis, whairat many war effrayed; for diverse suspected that
England wald nott be so fordwarde in tymes to cum, considering
that thair formar expensses war so great. The principall
conforte remaned with the preacheouris; for thei assured us in
Goddis name, that God should performe in all perfectioun
that worke in our handis, the begyning whairof he had so
mychtelie mainteaned, becaus it was not ouris, but his awin;
and thairfoir exhorted us that we should constantlie proceid
to reforme all abuses, and to plant the ministerie of the
Churche, as by Goddis word we mycht justifie it, and then
committ the successe of all to our God, in whose power the
dispositioun of kingdomes standis. And so we begane to do,
for troubles appearing, maid us give ear to the admonitionis of
Goddis servandis. And whill that we had skarslie begune
agane to implore the helpe of our God, and to schaw some
signes of our obedience unto his messingeris, and holy worde,
lo! the potent hand of God from above send unto us a wonderfull
and most joyfull deliverance: For unhappy Francis,
husband to our Soverane, suddandlie perissheth of a rottin
ear. But becaus the death of that child was nott onlie the
cause of joy to us in Scotland, but also by it war the faythfull
in France delivered, as it ware, from the present death, we
think expedient to entreat the same somewhat more largelie.</p>

<p>These cruell and conjured ennemyes of God, and of all godlynes,
the Duck of Gwyse, the Cardinall of Lorane, and thair
factioun, who then at thair awin appetite plaide the tyrantis
in France, had determined the destructioun<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> of all that professed
the trew knowledge of Jesus Christ within that Realme.
What tyranny laite befoir thei had used at Amboyse, the historie
of France doth witness. Now, in Orleance, in the moneth
of November, conveyned the King, unhappie Francis, the
Quene oure Soverane, and the Quene Mother, the Duck of
Gweise, with all his factioun, the King of Navar, and the
Prince his brother.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> So that great was the confluence of the
Nobilitie; but greater was the assemblie of the murtheraris;
for thair was nott a hangman in all France whiche was nott
thair. The preasonis ware full of the trew servandis of God:
the King of Navar and the Prince war constitut preasonaris.
The Schereff of Orleance, a man fearing God, was tackin, and
so war many otheris of the toune. Breiflie, thair was none
that professed God or godlyness within that toune, that looked
nott for the extreamitie; for the walles and yettis war nycht
and day keapt with tha garnysonis of the Gwysianes: miserable
men war dalie browght in to suffer judgement, but none
was suffered to departe furth butt at the devotioun of the
tyrantis. And so thei proceided till the tent or twelft<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> of December,
when that thei thowght tyme to putt thair bloody
counsall in executioun, and for that purpoise conclusioun was
tackin that the King should departe of the toune, and lye at
a certane place; whiche was done to this intent, that thair
should no suyte be maid to the King for the saiftie of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
manis lyfe, whome thei thowght worthy of death. And so
was the Kingis house in Orleance broken up, his beddis,
cofferis, and tapistree sent away; his awin buttis putt on, he
sitting at the Messe, immediatlie thairafter to have departed,
and so thair tyrannie to have begune,&mdash;when all thingis, we
say, war into this readdyness to sched the bloode of innocentis,
the Eternall, our God, who ever watches for the preservatioun
of his awin, begane to work, and suddandlie did put his awin
werk in executioun. For as the said King satt at Messe, he
was suddandlie strikkin with ane aposthume, in that deaf eare
that never wald hear the treuth of God; and so was he
caryed to ane void house, layd upoun a palliase unto suche
tyme as a cannabie was sett up unto him; whair he lay till
the fyftene day of December, in the year of God J<sup>m</sup> V<sup>c</sup> threscoir
yearis,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> when his glorie perished, and the pryde of the
stubburne heart evanished in smok. And so was the snare
brokin, the tyrantis disappoynted of thair crueltye; those that
war appointed to death rased, as it war out of thair graves;
and we, who by our foolischnes had maid our selves slaves to
strangearis, war restored agane to freedome and libertie of a

<p>The death of this King maid great alteratioun in Fraunce,
England, and Scotland. France was erected in some esperance,
that the tyranny of the Gwysianis should no longar ring above
thame, becaus that God at unwares had brokin the staff
whairupoun thei leaned. But, allace, thei war deceaved: for
the simplicitie of some was so abused, that, against the lawes
of the Realme, to the Quene Mother was committed regiment:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
which lifted up asweill the Duck of Gwyse, as the cruell Cardinall
for a seassone.</p>

<p>The Quene of England and the Counsall, remitted our
Ambassadouris with answer, "That sche wald nott marye hastelye,
and, thairfoir, willed the Counsall of Scotland, and the
Erle of Arrane, foirsaid, nott to depend upoun any hope thairof."<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
What motives she had, we omitt.</p>

<p>The pryde of the Papists of Scotland begane to be abated,
and some that ever had schawin thame selfis ennemyes unto
us, begane to think, and planelie to speak, (amanges whom the
auld Schiref of Ayr<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> was one,) that thei perceaved God to
feght for us. The Erle of Arrane him self did more patientlie
abyd the repulse of the Quene of England, becaus that he was
nott altogitther without hope that the Quene of Scotland bare
unto him some favour. And so he wrait unto her, and send
for credite a ryng, whiche the said Quene our Soverane knew
well yneuch. The letter and ring war baith presented to the
Quene, and of her receaved. Answer was returned to the
said Erle, after the whiche he maid no farther persuyte in that
mater: and yitt, not the less, he bare it heavelie in harte,<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> and
more heavelie then many wold have wissed.</p>

<p>The certaintie of the death foirsaid was signified unto us
both by sea and land. By sea receaved Johnne Knox (who
then had great intelligence both with the churches,<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> and some

Arrane was in Jedburgh,) to whome he opened such newis as
he had receaved, and willed thame to be of good conforte;

required of him, as of the rest of Papistis, that thei wald
suffer thair doctrin, constitutionis, and ceremonies to come to
tryall; and principallie, that the Messe, and the opinioun
thairof by thame taught unto the people, mycht be laid to the
squair-reull of Goddis worde, and unto the rycht institutioun
of Jesus Christ, that thei mycht understand whither that
thair Preacheris offended or nott, in that, that thei affirmed,
"The actioun of the Messe to be expressedlye repugnyng unto
the last Supper of the Lord Jesus; the sayar of it to committ
horrible blasphemye, in usurping upoun him the office of
Christ; the hearars to committ damnable idolatrie, and the
opinioun of it conceaved to be derogatioun, and as it war, disanulling
of Christis death." Whill that the said Maister Alexander
denyed that the preast took upoun him Christis office,
to offer for syne, as was alledged, a Messe book was produced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and in the begyning of the Canon war these wordis redd:
<i>Suscipe, Sancta Trinitas, hanc oblationem, quam ego indignus
peccator offero tibi vivo Deo et vero, pro peccatis meis, pro
peccatis totius Ecclesiæ vivorum et mortuorum, &amp;c.</i><a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> "Now,
(said the reasonare,) yf to offer for the synnes of the haill Kirk
was nott the office of Christ Jesus, yea, that office that to him
onlie mycht, and may apparteane, lett the Scripture judge.
And yf a vyle knave, whome ye call the preast, proudlie tackis
the same upoun him, lett your awin hook witnesse." The said
Maister Alexander ansuered, "Christ offered the propitiatorie,
and that could nane do but he; but we offer the remembrance."
Whairto it was ansuered, "We praise God, that ye
have denyed a sacrifice propitiatorie to be in the Masse; and
yet we offer to prove, that in mo then a hundreth places of
your Papisticall Doctouris, this propositioun is affirmed, 'The
Messe is a sacrifice propitiatorie.' But, to the secound parte,
whair ye allege that ye offer Christ in remembrance, we ask,
first, Unto whome do ye offer him? and nixt, By what authoritie
are ye assured of weall-doing? In God the Father, thair
fallis no oblivioun: and yf ye will yitt schift and say, That
ye offer it nott as God war forgetfull, but as willing to apply
Christis merittis to his Churche; we demand of you, What
power and commandiment ye have so to do? We know that
our Maister, Christ Jesus, commanded his Apostles to do that
whiche he did 'in remembrance of him;' but plane it is, that
Christ took bread, gave thankis, braik bread, and gave it to
his disciples, saying, 'Tak ye, eat ye; this is my body
whiche is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me,'
&amp;c. Here we fynd a commandiment to tak, to eat, to tak
and to drink; but to offer Christis body eather for remembrance
or applicatioun, we fynd not: and thairfoir, we say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to tack upoun you ane office which is nott gevin unto you, is
injust usurpatioun, and no lauchfull power." The said Maister
Alexander being more then astonished, wold have schifted;
but then the Lordis willed him to ansuer directlie. Whairto
he ansured, "That he was better seane in philosophie, then in
theologie." Then was commanded Maister Johne Leslie, (who
then was Parsone of Une, and now Lord Abbote of Londoris,)<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
to ansuer to the formare argument: and he with grait gravitie
begane to answer, "Yf our Maister have nothing to say to it,
I have nothing; for I knaw nothing but the Cannoun Law:
and the greatest reassone that ever I could fynd thair, is <i>Nolumus</i>
and <i>Volumus</i>." And yitt we understand that now he
is the onlie patrone of the Messe. But it is no mervall, for
he understoode that he is a Preastis gett; and thairfoir we
should nott wonder albeit that the auld trowane verse be
trew, <i>Patrem sequitur sua proles</i>. The Nobilitie hearing that
neather the one nor the other wold ansure directlie, said, "We
have bene miserable deceaved heirtofoir; for yf the Messe
may not obteane remissioun of synnes to the quick and to the
dead, whairfoir war all the Abacyes so richelie doted with oure
temporall landis?"</p>

and Apostles, conteined in the buiks of the Auld and
New Testaments, is the onely trew and most absolute foundatioun
of the universall Kirk of Christ Jesus, insamekill that in
the same Scriptures ar conteined all things necessary to be
beleved for the salvatioun of Mankind?</p>

utterly refuis all Doctrine alleged necessary to Salvatioun, that
is not expressedly conteined in the same.</p>

the flesche, to wit, the Sone of David, the Seid of Abrahame,
conceaved by the Holy Ghost, borne of the Virgin Marie his
mother, the onely Head and Mediatour of his Kirk?</p>

<p>Answer.&mdash;He is, and without him thair is nouther salvatioun

God, the Eternall Sone of the Eternall Father, in quhome all

acknawlege myself to be a man subject to infirmity,
and ane that hes neid of correctioun and admonitioun; and
tharefoir I maist willingly submit and subject my self to the
hailsume disciplin of the Kirk; yea, to the discipline of the

chairge; and heir in God's presens and youris do promeis
obedience to all admonitiones, secretly or publickly gevin;
unto the quhilk, if I be found inobedient, I confes myself
most worthie to be ejected not onely from this honour, bot
also frome the society of the Faythfull, in cais of my stubburnnes:
For the vocatioun of God to bear charge within his
Kirk, makethe not men tyrantes, nor lordis, but appoynteth

mouthe? Will ye not receave of him the sermone of exhortatioun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
with patience, not refuising the hailsome medicine of
your saules, althocht it be bitter and unpleising to the flesche?
Will ye not finally, mantene and comforte him in his ministry,
against all sick as wickedly wald rebell against God and his
holy ordinance?</p>

<p>The Peple answereth.&mdash;We will, as we will answer to the
Lord Jesus, quho hes commandit his Ministeris to be had in
reverence, as his ambassadours, and as men that cairfully
watche for the salvatioun of our saullis.</p>

<p>Let the Nobility also be urged with this.&mdash;Ye have heard the
dewty and professioun of this your Brother, by your consentis
appointit to this charge; as also the dewty and obedience,
quhilk God requireth of us towards him heir in his ministry:
Bot becaus that neyther of bothe are abill to performe ony thing
without the especiall grace of our God in Christ Jesus, quho
hes promeised to be with us present, even to the consummatioun
of the world; with unfayned hairtis, let us crave of

Walk in simplicity and purenes of lyfe, as it becumethe the

not dominioun nor tyrranicall impyre over thy brethrein. Be
not discouraged in adversity, bot lay befoir thyself the example
of Propheits, Apostles, and of the Lord Jesus, quho in
thair ministry susteaned contradictioun, contempt, persecutioun
and deyth. Feir not to rebuik the warld of sinne, justice,
and jugement. If ony thing succeid prosperously in thy vocatioun,
be not puft upe with pryde; nether yit flatter thy
self as that the gude succes proceided from thy vertew, industry,
or cair: Bot let ever that sentence of the Apostle
remane in thy hairt; "Quhat hes thou, quhilk thou hes not
receavit? If thou hes receivit, quhy gloriest thou?" Comfort
the afflicted, support the puir, and exhort utheris to support
thame. Be not solist for things of this lyfe, bot be fervent in
prayer to God for incress of his Holy Spirit. And finally, behave
thyself in this holy vocatioun, with sick sobriety, as God
may be glorified in thy ministry: And so sall thow schortly

<p>And this Ordour hes bene ever observed sen that tyme in

quhilk enormitie wes of mony yeiris left and dampnit by statute
and act of Parliament. Yit wald thay nott be forbiddin, bot
wald disobey and truble the Towne, especiallie upone the nycht.
Quhairat the Baillies offendit, tuke fra thame some swerdis
and an enseynze, quhilk wes occasioun that thay that same
nycht maid a mutinye, keippit the portis of the towne, and
intendit to have persewit some men within thair awin housses;
bot that, upoun the restitutioun of thair swerdis and enseynze,

inhabitantes of Edinburgh as diverse countrey men, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
frome thame money, and threitnyng some with farder injureis.
Quhairwith the Magistratis of the towne, heychtlie offendit,
tuke mair diligent heid to suche as resortit to the towne, and
so apprehendit ane of the principall of that misordour, namit
Gillone,<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> a cordinare, quhome thai put to ane assisse; [and

the cheif man that spoillit Johnne Mowbray of ten crownis of
the Sone,) thai thocht to have execute jugement upone him,
and so erected a jebbete beneath the Croce. But, quhidder it
came by pactioun with the Provest and some uther, or by instigatioun
of the Craftismen, quha ever haif bene bent too
muche to mayntene suche vanitie and ryotousnes, we fullie
knaw nott, but suddandlie thair did ryse a tumult; the Tolbuyth

invasioun of the said chalmer. Quhilk perceavit, the Provest,
and such as wer in his cumpany, past to the Tolbuyth, suspecting
nothing that thai wald haif bene sa enragit that thai wald
mak new persute, efter that thai had obtenit thair intent:
Bot thai wer suddandlie deceavit, for from the Castelhill thai
come with violence, and with stanis, gunnis, and such uther
weaponis as thei had, began to assault the said Tolbuyth, ran
at the dure of it, quhilk that parte by stanis cast from above,
and partlie by a pystoll schott by Robert Norwell, quhilk hurt
ane Twedy, thai wer repulsit [fra the door]; bot yit ceassit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
not thai to cast and schute in at the wyndowis, threitnyng
deith to all that war within. And in verray deid the malice
of the craftismen, quho wer suspectit to be the occasioun of
that tumult, bare na gude will to dyvers of thame that wes
with the Provost.</p>

<p>The argumentis that the Craftis wer the caus of that uproire,
besydis thair first misordour that thai haid usit befoir,
in tackin Sandersoun from the exectioun of punishment, are
twa. The formar, Archibald Dewar, Patrik Schange, with
uther five deaconis [of the craftis] come to Johnne Knox, and
willit him to solist the Provest and the towne to delay the
executioun: quho did answer, "That he haid sa oft solistit in
thair favouris, that his awin conscience accusit him, that thai
usit his labouris for na uther end, bot to be a patrone to
thair impietie." For he haid befoir maid intercessioun for
William Harlaw, James Frissall, and utheris, that wer convict
of the formare tumult. Thai proudlie said, "That gif it was
not stayit, bayth he and the Baillies suld repent it." Quhairto
he answerit, "He wald not hurt his conscience for ony
feir of man." And sa thai departit; and the tumult (as said
is) immediatlie thairefter did aryse. The secund argument
is, the tumult continewit fra twa at efter none till efter
aucht at nycht. The Craftismen wer requyrit to assemble
them selfis togidder for deliverance of thair Provest [and
Baillies]; bot thai past to thair foure houris penny, and in
thair jesting said, "Thai will be Magistratis allone, latt
thame reule the multitude allone." And sa, contrair to the
ayth that thai haid maid, thai denyit thair assistance, counsall,
and conforte to thair Provest and Baillies; quhilk ar argumentis
verray probable, that the said tumult raise by thair
procurement. The end heirof was, that the Provest<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Baillies wer compellit to gif thair handwrittis, that thai suld
never perseu ony of thame that war of that tumult, for ony
cryme that wes done in that behalf. And this wes proclamet
at the Croce efter nyne houris at nycht; and sa that truble
quyetted. Bot the Nobilitie avowit, that thai suld not spare
it; and sa a greit nomber of that factioun war absent frome
the towne, till the arryvall of the Quene. The haill multitude
wer haldin excomunicat, and war admittit to no participatioun
of the sacramentis, unto suche tyme as thai satisfied the Magistratis,
and maid humble sute unto the Kirk.</p>

hir Realme, we stayed it from danger. And now, having
promissed to keip gude peace with hir, and you hir subjectis,
we have hitherto observed it; and salbe sorye gif eather scho

resteth, to considder this mater deiplie, and to mak us ansuer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>

advise procure the Quene to ratifie it, we also planelie promisse
yow, that we will also continew oure gude dispositioun
to keip the same in such gude termes as now it is: and in so
doing, the honour of Almychty God sall be dewly soucht and

enjoy hir stait with suyrtie; and your selfis possesse that
quhilk yow have with tranquillitie, to the encreas of your
families and posterities quhilk by the frequent warris heirtofoir
your ancestouris never haid long in one estaite.</p>

<p>To conclude, We requyre yow to advertise us of quhat mynd
yow be, speciallie gif yow all continew in that mynd, that yow
meane to have the peace betwix boith the Realmes perpetuallie
keipit. And gif yow sall forbeir ony long tyme to

quhairof moir hurt may grow than gude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seeing</span> that Christ Jesus is he quhom God the Father hes

urge it necessarie, that his Evangell<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> be trewlie and openlie

<p class="center"><i>The Explicatioun of the First Head.</i></p>

<p>Least upone this our<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> generalitie ungodlie men tak occasioun
to cavill, this we adde for explicatioun. By preching
of the Evangell, we understand nott onlie the Scripturis of
the New Testament, bot also of the Auld; to wit, the Law,
Propheittis, and Histories, in quhilk Christ Jesus is no les
conteaned in figure, then we have him now expressed in veritie:
And, thairfoir, with the Appostill we affirme, that "All
Scripture inspired of God is profitable to instruct, to reprove,
and to exhorte." In quhilk buykis of Auld and New Testamentis
we affirme, that all thingis necessarie for the instructioun
of the Kirk, and to mak the man of God perfite, is conteaned
and sufficientlie expressed.</p>

<p>By the contrarie Doctrine, we understand quhatsoever men,
by Lawis, Counsallis, or Constitutionis have imposed upone the
consciences of men, without the expressed commandiment of
Goddis word; suche as be [the] vowis of chastitie, foirswering
of marriage, bindyng of men and wemen to severall and
disagysed apparrellis, to the superstitious observatioun of fasting
dayis, difference of meit for conscience saik, prayer for the
deid; and keping of holy dayis of certane Sanctis commandit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
by man, suche as be all those that the Papistis have invented,

Virgenis, of Christmess, Circumcisioun, Epiphany, Purification,

in Goddis Scripturis thai nather have commandiment nor assurance,

<div class="sidenote">THE
NOMBER
OF SACRAMENTIS.</div>

<p>To Christ Jesus his holie Evangell trewlie preached, of
necessitie it is, that his holie Sacramentis be annexit, and
trewlie ministred, as seallis and visible confirmationis of the
spirituall promisses contened in the wourd: And thai be two,
to wit, Baptisme, and the Holie Supper of the Lord Jesus:
quhilk ar then rychtlie ministred, quhen by a lauchfull Minister
the pepill, befoir the administratioun of the same, ar
planelie instructed, and put in mynd of Goddis free grace and
mercy, offered unto the penitent in Christ Jesus; quhen
Goddis promisses ar rehersit, the end and use of the Sacramentis
declared,<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> and that in suche a toung as the pepill dois
understand; quhen farther to thame is nothing added, from
thame no thing diminissit, and in thair practise nathing changit
besydis the institutioun of the Lord Jesus, and practise of
his holie Apostles.</p>

<p>And albeit the Ordour of Geneva,<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> quhilk now is used
in some of oure kirks, is sufficient to instruct the diligent
reader, how that boyth these Sacramentis may be rychtlie
ministred; yit for ane uniformitie to be keipit, we have thocht
gude to adde this as superaboundand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>In Baptisme, we acknawlege nothing to be used except the
element of wattir onlie, (that the wourd and declaratioun of
the promisses aucht to preceid we haif said befoir.) Quhairfoir,
quhosoevir presumeth in baptisme to use oyle, salt, wax,
spattill,<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> conjuratioun, or croceing, accuseth the perfyte institutioun
of Christ Jesus of imperfectioun; for it wes void of all
suche inventionis devysed by men: And suche as wald presume
to alter Christis perfite ordinance yow aucht seveirlie to
punische.</p>

<p>The Tabill of the Lord is then most rychtlie ministred,
quhen it approacheth most ney to Christis awin actioun: But
plane it is, that at that Supper, Christ Jesus sat with his
discipillis, and thairfoir do we juge, that sitting at a table is
most convenient to that holie actioun: that breid and wyne
aucht to be thair; that thankis aucht to be gevin; distributioun
of the same maid; and commandiment gevin that the
breid suld be tackin and eittin; and that all suld likewise
drink of the cowp of wyne, with declaratioun quhat boyth the
one and the other is, we suppoise no godlie man will doubt.
For as tuiching the dampnabill erroure of the Papistis, quho
can<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> defraude the commoun pepill of the one parte of that
holie Sacrament, to wit, of the coupe of the Lordis blude, we
suppois thair errour to be so manifest, that it needeth no confutatioun;
nather yit intend we to confute any thing in this
oure simple confessioun; but to offer publict disputatioun to
all that list oppung any thing affirmed by us.</p>

<p>That the Minister break the breid, and distribute the same
to those that be nyxt unto him, commanding the rest, every
one with reverence and sobrietie, to breake with other, we
think it nyest to Christis actioun, and to the perfite practise
[of the Apostles,] as we reid it in Sanct Paull. During the
quhilk actioun, we think it necessarie, that some comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
places of [the] Scripturis be red, quhilk may bring in mynd
the deith of Christ Jesus, and the benefite of the same; for
seing that in that actioun we aucht chieflie to remember the
Lordis deith, we juge the Scripturis macking mentioun of the
same most apt to stear up our dull myndis then, and at all
tymes. Lett the discretioun of the ministeris appoint the
places to be red as thai think gude. Quhat tymes we think
most convenient for the administratioun of the one and of
the other of these Sacramentis, salbe declared in the Policie
of the Kirk.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Thrid Head, tuiching the Abolissing
of Idolatrie.</span><a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>As we require Christ Jesus to be trewlie preached, and his
holie Sacramentis to be rychtlie ministerit; so can we not cease
to requyre Idolatrie, with all monumentis and places of the
same, as Abbayis, monkeries,<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> freireis, nunreis, chapellis, chantreis,
cathedrall kirkis, channounreis, colledges, uthers then
presentlie are paroche Kirkis or Sculis, to be utterlie suppressed
in all boundis and places of this Realme (except onlie
the Palacies, mansionis, and dwelling places adjacent thairto,
with orchartis and yardis of the samyn): As also that Idolatrie
may be removed from the presence of all personis of quhat
estait or conditioun that ever thai be, within this Realme.</p>

<p>For latt your Honouris be assuredlie persuaded, that quhair
Idolatrie is mayntened or permitted quhair it may be suppressed,
that thair sall Goddis wraith reigne, not onlie upone
the blind and obstinat idolater, but also upone the negligent
sufferaris [of the same;] especiallie gif God have armed thair
handis with power to suppress suche abhominatioun.</p>

<p>By Idolatrie we understand, the Messe, Invocatioun of
Sanctis, Adoratioun of Ymagis, and the keping and retenying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
of the same: and finallie all honoring of God, not conteaned
in his holie Word.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Fourt Head, concernyng Ministeris and thair
Lauchfull Electioun.</span><a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a Kirk reformed or tending to reformatioun, none aucht
[to] presume eather to preache, eather yit to minister the
Sacramentis, till that ordourlie thai be callit to the same.
Ordinarie vocatioun consisteth in Electioun, Examinatioun, and
Admissioun. And becaus that Electioun of Ministeris in this
cursed Papistrie hes altogither bene abused, we think expedient
to intreat it moir largelie.</p>

<p>It apperteneth to the Pepill, and to everie severall Congregatioun,
to Elect thair Minister: And in caise that thai be
fundin negligent thairin the space of fourty dayis, the best reformed
kirk, to wit, the churche of the Superintendent with
his Counsall, may present unto thame a man quhom thai
juge apt to feade the flock of Christ Jesus, who must be
examinated alsweill in lyiff and maneris, as in doctryne and
knawlege.</p>

<p>And that this may be done with moir exact diligence,
the personis that ar to be examinated must be commanded
to compeir<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> befoir men of soundest jugement, remanying
in some principall towne nyxt adjacent unto thame; as thai
that be in Fyffe, Anguss, Mernyss, or Straytherne, to present
thame selfis in Sanctandrois; those that be in Lowthiane,
Merse, or Teviotdaill, to Edinburgh; and likewise those that
be in other countreis mon resorte to the best reformed citeis
or townis, that is, to the citie<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> of the Superintendent; quhair
first in the scoillis, or failling thairof in open assemblie, and
befoir the congregatioun, thai most geve declaratioun of thair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
giftis, utterance, and knawlege, by interpreting some place of
Scripture to be appointed be the ministerie. Quhilk being
ended, the persone that is presented, or that offered him self
to the administratioun of the kirk, must be examined by the
ministeris and elderis of the kirk, and that opinlie and befoir
all that list to hear, in all the cheif pointes that now
lie in contraversie betwix us and the Papistis, Anabaptistis,
Arrians, or other suche ennemies to the Christiane religioun.
In quhilk gif he be found sound, abill to persuade by hailsome
doctryne, and to convince the gaynsayaris, then must
he be directed to the Kirk and Congregatioun quhair he suld
serve, that thair, in oppin audience of his flock, in diverse
publict sermonis, he may gif confession of his faith in the
articles of Justificatioun, of the office of Christ Jesus, of the
nomber, effect, and use of the Sacraments; and, finallie, of
the hoill religioun, quhilk heirtofoir hath bene corrupted by
the Papistis.</p>

<p>Gif his doctrine be found holesome, and able to instruct the
simple, and if the Kirk justlye can reprehend nothing in his
lyiff, doctryne, nor utterance, then we juge the Kirk, quhilk
befoir wes destitute, unreasonabill if thai refuse him quhom
the Kirk did offer; and that thai suld be compelled, by the censure
of the Counsall and Kirk, to receive the persone appoynted
and approvin by the jugement of the godlie and lerned; unless
that the same Kirk have presented a man better or alsweill
qualifeid to the examinatioun, befoir that this foirsaid tryell
wes takin of the persone presented by the counsall of the hoile
Kirk. As, for example, the Counsall of the Kirk presentis to
any kirk a man to be thair minister, not knawing that thai
ar utherwayis provided: in the meyntyme, the Kirk is provided
of ane uther, sufficient in thair jugement for that charge,
quhom thai present to the lerned Ministeris and next reformed
Kirk to be examinated. In this case the presentatioun of
the Pepill, to quhom he suld be appointed pastour, must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
preferred to the presentatioun of the Counsall or greater Kirk;
unless the persone presented by the inferiour Kirk be juged
unabill for the regiment by the lerned. For altogither this is
to be avoided, that any man be violentlie intrused<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> or thrust
in upoun any Congregatioun. But this libertie with all cair
must be reserved till everie severall Kirk, to have thair votis
and suffragis in electioun of thair Ministeris. But violent intrusioun
we call nott, quhen the Counsall of the Kirk, in
the feare of God, and for the salvatioun of the pepill, offereth
unto thame a sufficient man to instruct thame; quhom thai
sall not be forced to admitt befoir just examinatioun, as befoir
is said.</p>


<p class="center">II. <span class="smcap">Quhat may unable ony persoun, that he may nott
be admitted to the Ministerie of the Kirk.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is to be observed that na persone, noted with publict infamye,
or being unabill to edifie the Kirk by hailsome doctrine,
or being knawin of corrupt jugement, be eather promoted to
the regiment of the Kirk, or yit receaved<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> in Ecclesiasticall
administratioun.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Explicatioun.</i></p>

<p>By publict Infamye we understand, nott the commoun
synnes and offences quhilk any hes committit in tyme of
blindnes, by fragilite; (gif of the same, by a better and more
sober conversatioun, he hath declared him self verielie penitent;)
but suche capitall crymes as the civile swerd aucht and
may punishe with deith by the wourd of God. For besydis
that the Apostill requyreth the lyif of Ministeris to be so irreprehensible,
that thai have a gude testimonye from those that
be without; we juge it a thing unseimlie and dangerouse, that
he sall have publict authoritie, to preiche to utheris the lyiff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
everlasting, from quhom the civile Magistrat may tak the lyiff
temporall for a cryrme publictlie committed: And gif ony
object, That the Prince hes pardoned his offence, and that he
hes publictlie repented, and so is not onlie his lyiff<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> in assurance,
but also that he may be receaved to the Ministerie of the
Kirk; we answer, That repentance dois nott tak away the
temporall punishment of the law, neither doth the pardon of
the Prince remove his infamye befoir man.</p>

<p>That the lyiff and conversatioun of the persone presented, or
to be elected, may be the more cleirlie knawin, publict Edictis
must be<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> directed to all partis of this Realme, or at the leist

as quhair he wes nurischit in letteris, or quhair he contineuit
from the yeiris of infancie and childhood war passed. Strait

declaratioun that suche as concealled his synnes knawin, did
deceave and betray (so far as in them lay) the Kirk, quhilk
is the spous of Jesus Christ, and did communicate with the
synnes of that wicked man.</p>


<p class="center">III. <span class="smcap">Admissioun [of Ministers.]</span></p>

<p>The admissioun of Ministeris to thair offices, must consist in
consent of the pepill and Kirk quhairto thai salbe appointed,
and in approbation of the learned Ministeris appointed for
thair examinatioun.</p>

<p>We juge it expedient, that the admissioun of Ministeris be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
in opin audience; that some especiall Minister mak a sermon
tuiching the deutie and office of Ministeris, tuiching thair
maneris, conversatioun, and lyif; as also tuiching the obedience
quhilk the Kirk aw<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> to thair Ministeris. Commandiment suld
be gevin alsweill to the Minister as unto the peple, boyth being
present, to witt, that he with all cairfull diligence attend
upone the flock of Christ Jesus, over the quhilk he is appointed
preacher:<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> that he [will] walk in the presence of God so
synceirlie, that the graces of the Holie Spreit may be multiplyed
into him; and in the presence of men so sobirlie and uprychtlie,
that his lyiff may confirme, in the eyis of men, that
quhilk by toung and wourd he persuaded unto utheris. The
people wald be exhorted to reverence and honour thair Ministers
chosin, as the servandis and ambassadouris of the Lord
Jesus, obeying the commandiments quhilk thai pronunce from
Goddis mouth and buyk,<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> evin as thai wald obey God him self;
for quhosoevir heareth Christis Ministeris heareth him self, and
quhosoevir rejecteth thame, [and] dispyseth thair ministerie
and exhortatioun, rejecteth and dispyseth Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Other ceremonie then the publict approbatioun of the peple,
and declaratioun of the cheiff minister, that the persone thair
presented is appoynted to serve that Kirk, we can nott approve;
for albeit the Apostillis used the impositioun of handis,
yet seing the mirakle is ceassed, the using of the ceremonie we
juge is nott necessarie.</p>

<p>The Minister elected or presented, examinated,<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> and, as
said is, publictlie admitted, man neather leave the floke at his
plesour, to the quhilk he hes promissit his fidelitie and lawbouris;
neather yit may the floke reject nor change him at
thair appetite, unless thai be abill to convict him of suche
crymes as deserve depositioun; quhairof we sall after speik.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
We meane nott bot that the hole Kirk, or the most parte
thairof, for just considerationis, may transfer a Minister frome
one kirk to another; neather yit meane we, that men quho
now do serve as it wer of benevolence may nott be appointed
and elected to serve in other places; but onis being solemndlie
elected and admitted, we can not approve that thai suld change
at thair awin plesour.</p>

<p>We are not ignorant, that the raritie of godlie and learned
men sall seme to some a just reassone quhy that so strait and
scharpe examinatioun suld not be takin universallie; for so it
sall appeir, that the most parte of [the] Kirkis sall haif no
Minister at all: But let these men understand, that the lack
of able men sall nott excuse us befoir God, gif by oure consent
unable men be placed over the floke of Christ Jesus; as
also that amangis the Gentilles, godlie, learned men war als
rare<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> as thai be now amangis us, quhen the Apostill gave the
same reul to try and examyne Ministeris, quhilk we now follow:
And last, lat thame understand that it is alike to have
no minister at all, and to have an idole in the place of a treu
minister, yea and in some case, it is worse; for those that be
utterlie destitute of ministeris wilbe diligent to search for
them; but those that have a vane schaddow, do commonlie
without farther cair content thame selfis with the same, and
so remane thai continewallie deceaved, thinking that thai have
a Minister, quhen in verray deid thai have none. For we can
nott juge him a dispensatour of Goddis mysteries, that in no
wyise can breke the breid of lyif to the faynting and hungrie
saulis; neather juge we that the Sacramentis can be rychtlie
ministred by him, in quhais mouth God hes put no sermon of
exhortatioun.</p>

<p>The cheiffest remedy left till your Honouris and to us, in all
this raritie of trew ministeris, is fervent prayer unto God, that
it will pleis his mercye to thrust out faithfull warkmen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
this his harvest;<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> and nyxt, that your Honouris, with consent
of the Kirk, are bound by your authoritie to compell
suche men as have giftis and graces able to edifie the Kirk
of God, that thai bestow thame quhair greittest necessitie salbe
knawin; for no man may be permittit to leve idill, or as
thame self list, but must be appointed to travell quhair your
Wisdomes and the Kirk sall think expedient.</p>

<p>We can nott prescryve unto your Honouris certane reull
how that ye sall distribute the ministeris and lerned men,
quhom God hes alreddy send unto you. But heirof we ar
assured, that it greitlie hindereth the progress of Christis
Evangell within this poore Realme, that some altogither
abstract thair lawbouris from the Kirk, and utheris remane togither<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
in one place, the most parte of thame being idill. And
thairfoir of your Honouris we requyre in Goddis name, that
by your auctoritie quhilk ye have of God, ye compell all men
to quhom God hes gevin ony talent to persuade, by holsome
doctrine, to bestow the same, gif thai be called be the Kirk
to the advancement of Christis glorie, and to the conforte of
his trublit flock; and that ye, with the consent of the Kirk,
assigne unto your cheiffest workmen, not onlie townis to remane
into, but also provinces, that be thair faithfull lawbouris
kirkis may be erected, and ordour established, quhair
none is now. And gif on this maner ye will use your power
and auctoritie, cheiflie seiking Goddis glorie, and the conforte
of your brethrein, we doubt not but God sall bliss you and
your interprisses.</p>

discreit ministeris, may be permittit to minister the sacramentis;
but not befoir that he be able somequhat to persuade
by holsome doctrine, besydis his reading, and be admitted
to the ministerie, as before is said. Some we knaw
that of long tyme have professed Christ Jesus, quhose honest
conversatioun deserved praise of all godlie men, and quhose
knawledge also mycht greatlie help the simple, and yit thai
onlie content thame selfis with reading. These must be animated,
and by gentle admonitioun incuraged, by some exhortatioun
to conforte thair brethrein, and so thai may be admitted
to administratioun of the sacramentis. But suche
Readeris as neather have haid exercise, nor continuance in
Christis trew religioun, must abstene from ministratioun of the
sacramentis, till thai geve declaratioun and witnessing of thair
honestie and farther knawlege.</p>

<p>Seing that of our Maister Christ Jesus and his Apostle

and that, "The mouth of the lawboring oxe aucht nott to be

the Ministeris, quhilk we requyre to be suche, that thai haif
neather occasioun of sollicitude, neather yit of insolencie and
wantoness. And this provisioun must be maid not onlie for
thair awin sustentatioun, during thair lyiffes, but also for thair
wiffis and childrene efter thame. For we juge it a thing most
contrariouse to reassone, godlines, and equitie, that the wedow

<p>Difficill it is to appoint a severall stipend to everie Minister,
be reassoun that the chargis and necessitie of all will not be
licke; for some wilbe contenewaris in one place, some wilbe
compellit to travell, and oft to change dwelling place, (gif thai
sall have charge of diverse kirkis.) Amangis these, some
wilbe burdened with wyiff and childrein, and one with mo
then ane other; and some perchance wilbe single men: Gif
equall stipendis suld be appointed to all those that in charge
ar so inequall, eather suld the one suffer penurie, or ellis suld
the uther have superfluitie and too muche.</p>

<div class="sidenote10">* ADDITIO.</div>

<p>* We juge, thairfor, that everie Minister have sufficient
quhairupoun to keip ane house, and be sustened honestlie in
all thingis necessarie, alsweill for keiping of his house, as
claithis, flesche, fische, buykis, [fewell,] and other thingis

[where he serveth,] at the discretioun of the congregatioun,
conforme to the qualitie of the persone and necessitie of
the tyme. Quhairin it is thocht [good] that everie Minister
sall have at leist fourtie bollis meill, and twenty-six bollis
malt, to find his house breid and drink; and mair, sa mekill<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> as
the discretioun of the Kirk findis necessarie; besydes money
for buying of uther provisioun to his house, and other necessaries,
the modificatioun quhairof is referred to the jugement of
the kirk, to be maid everie yeir at the chosing of the eldaris
and deaconis of the kirk. Providing alwayis, that thair be
advanced to everie minister sufficient provisioun for ane quarter
of ane yeir befoir hand of all thingis.</p>

<p>To him<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> that travelleth from place to place, quhom we call

thai be found apt therto; and failing thairof that thai be put

quhairby thai may be profitable membres in a commoun

<div class="sidenote10">* ADDITIO</div>

<p>* And the same we requyre for thair douchteris; to wit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
that thai be verteouslie brocht up, and honestlie doted quhen
thai come to maturitie of yeiris, at the discretioun of the Kirk.</p>

<p>And this in Goddis presence we witness, we requyre nott
so muche for oure selfis, or for any that till us apperteneth,
as that we do for the encrease of vertew and learnyng,
and for the proffeit of the posteritie to come. It is nott
to be supposed that all man<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> will dedicat him self and
childrene so to God, and to serve his kirk, that thai luyke for
no warldlie commoditie. But this cankered nature quhilk we
beare, is provokit to follow vertew quhen it seith honour and
profeit annexit to the same;<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> as, contrairlie, then is vertew of
mony despised, quhen verteouse and godlie men leve without
honour. And sorye wuld we be that povertie suld discourage
men from studye, and from following the way of vertew, by the
quhilk thai mycht edifie the kirk and flock of Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Nothing have we spokin of the stipend of Readaris, becaus,
gif thai can do nothing but reade, thai neather can be called
nor jugit trew ministeris: And yit regard must be haid to
thair lawbouris; but so that thai may be spurred fordwart to
vertew, and nott by a stipend appointed for thair reading, to
be reteaned still in that estait. To a Readare thairfor that
is laitlie enterit, we think fourty markis, or mair or less, as
the Parochenaris and Readaris can agree, sufficient: providing
that he teiche the childrene of the parische, quhilk he must
do, besydis the reading of the Commoun Prayeris,<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> and buykis
of the New and Auld Testamentis. Gif frome Reading he begin
to Exhorte<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> and explane the Scriptures, then aucht his
stipend to be augmented; till finallie he come to the honour
of a Minister: But and gif he be found unable efter two
yeiris, then must he be removed from that office, and dischargit
of all stipend, that another may be provin als lang.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
For this alwayis is to be avoyded, that none quho is jugit unabill
to come at ony tyme to some reasonable knawlege,
quhairby he may edifie the Kirk, sall perpetuallie be nurisshed<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>
upone the charge of the kirk. Farther, it must be avoided,
that no child or persone within aige, that is, within xxj yeir of
aige, be admitted to the office of a Readare; but Readaris
aucht to be endewed with gravitie, witt, and discretioun, lest
be thair lychtness the Prayeris or Scripturis read be of less
price and estimatioun. It is to be noted, that the Readaris
be putt in by the Kirk, and admissioun of the Superintendent.</p>

<div class="sidenote10"><i>NOTA</i></div>

<p>The other sorte of Readaris, quho have long continewed in
godliness, and have some gift of Exhortatioun, quho are in
hope to atteane to the degree of a minister, and teche the

the Word, and minister the Sacramentis.</p>

<p>Restis yit other two sortis of peple to be provided for, of
that quhilk is called the patrimonye of the Kirk; to wit, the
Poore, and Teachearis of the youtheid. Every severall Kirk
must provide for the poore within the self; for fearful and
horrible it is, that the poore, quhom nott onlie God the Father
in his law, but Christ Jesus in his evangell, and the Holie
Spreit speaking by Sanct Paule, hath so earnestlie commended
to oure cayre, ar universallie so contempned and dispysed.
We ar nott patronis for stubburne and idill beggaris, quho,

but the stout and strong beggar must be compelled to wirk,
and everie persoun that may nocht wirk, must be compelled to
repair to the place whare he or scho was born, (unles of long
continuance thai have remaned in one place,) and thair reassonable
provisioun must be maid for thair sustentatioun, as the
Churche shall appoint. The ordour nor soumes, in oure judgementis,
can nott be particularlie appointed, unto suche tyme
as the poore of everie citie, toun, or parrishe, be compelled to
repair to the places whaire thei war borne, or of thair residences,

<p>We considder that yf the Ministeris whome God hath endewed
with his [singular] graces amangis us, should be appointed
to severall and certane placis, thair to mak thair continuall
residence, that then the greatest part off this Realme
should be destitute of all doctrine; whiche should not onlie be
occasioun of greate murmure, but also should be dangerus to
the salvatioun of manye. And thairfore we have thocht it a
thing most expedient for this tyme, that frome the whole
nomber of godlie and learned [men], now presentlie in this
Realme, be selected twelf or ten, (for in sa mony Provincis have
we divideit the hoill,) to whome charge and commandiment
shalbe gevin<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> to plant and erect churches, to set ordour and
appoint ministeris (as the formar Ordour prescribeth) to the
contreis that sall be appointed to thair cayre whaire none ar
now; and by these meannis [your] luff and common caire ower
all the inhabitantis of this Realme (to quhome ye ar equall
debttouris) shall evidentlie appeare; as also the simpill and
ignorant (who perchance have never heard Christ Jesus trewlie
preached) shall come to some knawlege, by the which manye
that now be deid in superstitioun and ignorance shall atteane
to some fealling of godlynes, by the whiche thei may be provocked
to searche and seik farther knawledge of God, and his
trew religioun and wirschipping. Whaire be the contrarie, yf
thei shalbe neglected, thei shall not onlie grudge, but also thei
shall seik the meanis whairby thei may continew in thair blindnes,
or returne to thair accustumed idolatrie. And thairfore
no thing desire we more earnistlie, then that Christ Jesus be
universallie once preached throuchout this Realme; whiche
shall not suddanlie be unles that by you, men be appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>

<p>Those men must not be sufferred to leave as your idill
Bischopis have done heirtofore; neather most thei remane
whaire gladlie thei wald: But thei must be preachearis thame

may be corrected.</p>

<p>Yf the Superintendent be fund negligent in any of these
cheaf pointis of his office, and especiallie yf he be noted negligent
in preacheing of the word, and in visitatioun of his

in the common Ministeris ar dampned, he must be deposit,
without respect of his persoun or office.</p>


<p class="center">III. <span class="smcap">Off the Electioun of Superintendentis.</span></p>

<p>In this present necessitie, the nominatioun, examinatioun,
and admissioun of Superintendentis, can not be so strait as we
require, and as afterward it must be.</p>

<p>For this present, thairfore, we think sufficient that eather
your Honouris, by your selves, nominat sa mony as may serve
the fore-written provincis; or that ye gyff commissioun to suche
men, as in whome ye suppoise the feir of God [to be] to do the
same; and that the same men being called in your presence
shalbe by you, and by suche as your Honouris please call unto
you for consultatioun in that case, appointed to thair provinces.
We think it expedient and necessarie, that als weill the gentilmen,
as burgesses of everie diocese, be maid privie at the same
tyme to the electioun of the Superintendent, alsweill to bring
the Churche in sum practise of hir libertie, as to mak the
pastor better favorit of the flocke whome thame selves have
chosin. Yff your Honouris can not find for this present sa
many able men as the necessitie requireth, then, in our judgementis,
more profitable it is that those provincis vaik till
God provide better, than that men unabill to edifie and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
governe the Churche be suddanlie placit in that charge. For
experience hath taught us,<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> what pestilence hath bene engendred
in the Church by men unabill to discharge thair
offices.</p>

<p>When, thairfore, after thre yeiris any Superintendent shall
departe, or chance to be deposed, the cheaf town within that
province, to wit, the Ministeris, Elders, and Deaconis, with the
Magistrat and Counsall of the same town, shall nominat, and
by publict edictis proclame, alsweill to the Superintendent, as
to twa or thre provinces nixt adjacent, two or thre of the most
learned and most godlie Ministeris within the hole realme,
that frome amangis thame, one with publict consent may be
electit and appointed to the office then vaiking: and this the
cheaf Town shall be bound to do within the terme of twenty
dayis. Whiche being expired and no man presented, then
shall thre of the nixt adjacent provincis, with consent of thair
Superintendentis, Ministeris, and Elderis, enter in into the
rycht and priviledgeis of the cheaf town, and shall present
everie one of thame one, or two yf thei list, to the cheaf town,
to be examinated as the Ordour requireth. As also, it shalbe
lauchfull for all the churches of the Diocesye to nominat within
the same tyme suche personis as thei think worthye to
stand in electioun; which man be put in edict.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>After the nominationis be maid, publict edictis must be
send, first warnyng all men that have any objectioun<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> againis
the personis nominatit, or against ony ane of thame, to be
present in the cheaf toun at day and place affixit, to object
what thei can against the electioun of any one of thame.
Threttye dayis we think sufficient to be assigned thairto;
thretty dayis, we meane, after that the nominatioun be maid.</p>

<p>Whiche day of electioun being come, the hoill Ministeris of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
that Province, with thre or mo<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> of the Superintendentis nixt
adjacent, or that sall thairto be named,<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> shall examyn not
onlie the learnying, but also the maneris, prudence, and habilitie
to governe the Churche, of all those that ar nominat; that
he who shallbe fund most worthye, may be burdened with the
charge. Yff the Ministeris of the whole Province should bring
with them the voitis of those that war committit to thair
caire, the electioun should be the more fre; bot alwayis, the
voitis of all those that convene must be requirit.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> The examinationis
must be publictlie maid; those that stand in electioun
must publictlie preache; and men must be chargeit in
the name of God, to voit according to conscience, and not efter
affectioun. Yf ony thing be objectit against any that stand<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>
in electioun, the Superintendentis and Ministeris must considder
whether the objectioun be maid of conscience or of
malice, and thei must ansueir accordinglie. Other ceremonies
then scharp examinatioun, approbatioun of the Ministeris and
Superintendentis, with the publict consent of the Elderis and
People, then present,<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> we can not allow.</p>

<p>The Superintendent being electit, and appointed to his
charge, must be subjected to the censur and correctioun of the
Ministeris and Elderis, not onlie of his cheaf Toun, but also of
the hoill Province over the whiche he is appointed oversear.</p>

<p>Yf his offencis<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> be knawin, and the Ministeris and Elderis
of his Province<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> be negligent in correcting him, then the nixt
one or two Superintendentis, with thair Ministeris and Elderis,
may convene him, and the Ministeris and Elderis of his cheaf
toun, (provideit that it be within his awin Province or cheaf
toun,) and may accuse and correct alsweale the Superintendent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
in those thingis that ar worthy of correctioun, as the
Ministeris and Elderis for thair negligence and ungodlie tollerance
of his offencis.</p>

<p>Whatsoever cryme deserve correctioun or depositioun of any
other minister, deserveth the samin in the Superintendent,
without exceptioun of persoun.</p>

<p>After that the Churche he establischeit,<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> and thre yeiris be
passed, we require that na man be callit to the office of a
Superintendent, who hath not tuo yeiris at the leist gevin declaratioun
of his faithfull lawbouris in the ministerie of some
churche.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>No Superintendent may be transferrit at the plesour or requeist
of ony one Province; no, not without the consent of the
whole counsall of the Churche, and that for grave causses and
considderationis.</p>

<p>Off one thing, in the end, we must admonische your Honouris,
to wit, that in appointing Superintendentis for this
present, ye disappoint not your cheaf Tounis, and whair learning
is exercised, of suche ministeris as more may proffit be residence
in one place, than be continewall travell frome place
to place: For if ye so do, the youth in those placis shall
lacke the profound interpretatioun of the Scripturis; and so
shall it be long before that your gardenis send furth many
plantis; whair by the contrarie, yf one or tuo tounis be continewallie
exercised as thei may, the Commoun-wealth shall
schortlie taist of thair fruct,<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> to the confort of the godlie.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">For the Schollis.</span><a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>Seeing that the office and dewtie of the godlie Magistrat is
nocht onlie to purge the Churche of God from all superstitioun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and to set it at libertie from bondage of tyrranis;<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> but
also to provide, to the uttermost of his power, how it may
abide in the same puritie to the posteriteis<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> following; we can
not but frelie<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> communicat our judgementis with your Honouris
in this behalf.</p>


<p class="center">I. <span class="smcap">The necessitie Of Schollis.</span><a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>Seing that God hath determined that his Churche heir in
earth, shallbe tawght not be angellis but by men; and seing
that men ar born ignorant of all godlynes; and seing, also,
now God ceassith<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> to illuminat men miraculuslie, suddanlie
changeing thame, as that he did his Apostlis and utheris in
the Primitive Churche: off necessitie it is that your Honouris
be most cairfull for the virtuous educatioun, and godlie upbringing
of the youth of this Realme, yf eathir ye now thirst unfeanedlie
[for] the advancement of Christis glorie, or yit desire
the continewance of his benefits to the generatioun following.
For as the youth must succeed till us, so aucht we to be cairfull
that thei have the knawlege and eruditioun, to proffit and
confort that whiche aucht to be most deare to us, to wit, the
Churche and Spouse of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>Off necessitie thairfore we judge it, that everie severall
Churche have a Scholmaister<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> appointed, suche a one as is
able, at least, to teache Grammer and the Latine toung, yf
the Toun be of any reputatioun. Yf it be Upaland, whaire the
people convene to doctrine bot once in the weeke, then must
eathir the Reidar or the Minister thair appointed, take cayre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
over the children and youth of the parische, to instruct them
in thair first rudimentis, and especiallie in the Catechisme,<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>
as we have it now translaited in the Booke of our Common
Ordour, callit the Ordour of Geneva.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> And farther, we think
it expedient, that in everie notable toun, and especiallie in
the toun of the Superintendent, [there] be erected a Colledge,
in whiche the Artis, at least Logick and Rethorick, togidder
with the Tongues, be read be sufficient Maisteris, for whome
honest stipendis must be appointed: as also provisioun for
those that be poore, and be nocht able by them selfis, nor by
thair freindis, to be sustened at letteris, especiallie suche as
come frome Landwart.</p>

<p>The frute and commoditie heirof shall suddanlie appeare.
For, first, the youtheid and tender children sall be nurischit
and brocht up in virtue, in presence of thair freindis; by
whose good attendence many inconvenientis may be avoided,
in the which the youth commonlie fallis, eathir by too muche<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>
libertie, whiche thei have in strange and unknawin placis,
whill thei can not rule them selfis; or ellis for lacke of gude
attendence, and of suche necessiteis as thair tender aige requireth.
Secoundarlie, The exercise of the children in everie
Churche shall be great instructioun to the aigeit.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<p>Last, The great Schollis callit Universiteis, shallbe repleanischit
with those that be apt to learnyng; for this must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
be cairfullie provideit, that no fader, of what estait or conditioun
that ever he be, use his children at his awin fantasie,
especiallie in thair youth-heade; but all must be compelled
to bring up thair children in learnyng and virtue.</p>

<p>The riche and potent may not be permitted to suffer thair
children to spend thair youth in vane idilnes, as heirtofore thei
have done. But thei must be exhorted, and by the censure of
the Churche compelled to dedicat thair sones, by goode exercise,<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>
to the proffit of the Churche and to the Common-wealth; and
that thei must do of thair awin expensses, becaus thei ar able.
The children of the poore must be supported and sustenit on
the charge of the Churche, till tryell be tackin, whethir the
spirit of docilitie be fund in them or not. Yf thei be fund
apt to letteris and learnyng, then may thei not (we meane,
neathir the sonis of the riche, nor yit the sonis of the poore,)
be permittit to reject learnyng; but must be chargeit to continew
thair studie, sa that the Commoun-wealthe may have
some confort by them. And for this purpose must discreit,
learned, and grave men be appointit to visit all Schollis for
the tryell of thair exercise, proffit, and continewance; to wit,
the Ministeris and Elderis, with the best learned in everie
toun, shall everie quarter tak examinatioun<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> how the youth
hath proffitted.</p>

<p>A certane tyme must be appointed to Reiding, and to learning
of the Catechisme; ane certane tyme to the Grammar, and
to the Latine toung; ane certane tyme to the Artis, Philosophie,
and to the [other] Toungis; and a certane to that studie
in which thei intend cheaflie to travell for the proffit of the
Commoun-wealth. Whiche tyme being expired, we meane in
everie course, the children must eathir proceid to farther
knawledge, or ellis thei must be send to sum handie-craft, or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
sum othir profitable exercise; provideit alwayis, that first thei
have the forme of knawledge<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> of Christiane religioun, to wit,
the knawledge of Goddis law and commandimentis; the use
and office of the same; the cheaf articulis of our beleve; the
richt forme to pray unto God; the nomber, use, and effect of
the sacramentis; the trew knawledge of Christ Jesus, of his
office and natures, and suche otheris,<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> as without the knawledge
wheirof, neathir deservith [any] man to be named a
Christiane,<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> neather aught ony to be admittit to the participatioun
of the Lordis Tabill: And thairfore, these principallis
aught and must be learned in the youth-heid.</p>


<p class="center">II. <span class="smcap">The tymes appointed to everie Course.</span></p>

<p>Two yearis we think more then sufficient to learne to read
perfitelie, to answer to the Catechisme, and to have some entresse
in the first rudimentis of Grammar; to the full accomplischement
whairof, (we meane of the Grammar,) we think
other thre or foure yearis at most, sufficient. To the Artis, to
wit, Logick and Rethorick, and to the Greik toung, foure
yeiris; and the rest, till the aige of twenty-foure yearis to be
spent in that studye, whairin the learnar wald proffit the
Churche or Commoun-wealth, be it in the Lawis, or Physick or
Divinitie: Whiche tyme of twenty-foure yearis being spent in
the schollis, the learnar most be removed to serve the Churche
or Commoun-wealth, unless he be fund a necessarie Reidare in
the same Colledge or Universitie. Yf God shall move your
heartis to establische and execut this Ordour, and put these
thingis in practise, your hole Realme, (we doubt nott,) within
few yearis, shall serve the self of trew preacharis, and of uther
officiaris necessarie for your Common-wealth.</p>

it most expedient that commoun Thesauraris, to wit, the Deaconis,
be appointed frome yeare to yeare, to resave the hoill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
rentis appertenyng to the Churche; and that commandiment
be given, that na man be permitted eather to resave, eather
yit to intromet with, any thing appertenyng to the sustentatioun
of the personis foresaidis, but suche as by commoun
consent of the Churche ar thairto appointed.</p>

<p>Yf any thinkis this prejudiciall to the tackis and assedationis
of those that now possessis the teyndis, let them understand
that ane injust possessioun is no possessioun before God;
for those of whome thei receaved thair titill and presupposed
richt, war and ar thevis<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> and murtheraris, and had no power
so to alienat the patrimonye and commoun-gude of the
Churche. And yit we ar not so extreme, but that we wische
just recompence to be maid to suche as have debursed soumes
of money to those injust possessouris (so that it hes not bene
of lait dayis in prejudice of the Churche:) but suche as ar
fund and knawin to be done of plane collusioun in no wise
aucht to be mantened of you. And for that purpose, we
think it most expedient that whosoever have assedatioun of
teyndis or churches be openlie warnit to produce thair assedatioun
and assurance, that cognitioun being tackin, the just
tackisman may have ane just and reasonable recompence for
the yearis that ar to ryn, the proffit of the yearis passed being
considderit and deducted; and the injust and surmised may
be servit accordinglie: So that the Churche, in the end, may
recover hir libertie and fredome, and that onlie for releaf of
the Poore.</p>

<p>Your Honouris may easilie understand, that we speake not
now for our selvis, but in favouris of the Poore and<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> the lawboraris

<p>But becaus this accursit Papistrie hath brocht in suche

libertie to syn: And thairfore this ordour we think expedient
to be observit before and efter excommunicatioun.</p>

<p>First, yf the offence be secreit and knawin to few,<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> and

declair him self sober, honest, and one that feareth God, and
feareth to offend his brethren, than may the secreit admonitioun
suffice for his correctioun. But gif he athir contempn
the admonitioun, or efter promis maid, do schaw him self no
more circumspect than he was before, than must the Minister
admonische him; to whome yf he be fund inobedient, thei
must proceid according to the reule of Christ, as efter sall be
declairit.</p>

<p>Gif the cryme be publict, and suche as is haynouse, as fornicatioun,

aucht to be declared and aggredgeit, so that his conscience
may feale how far he hath offended God, and what sklander
he hath rasit in the Churche.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> Yf signis of unfeinyeit repentence

whan the hoill Churche convenith togidder, that in presence

professed: Whiche yf he accept, and with reverence do, confessing
his syn, and dampnyng the same,<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> and earnestlie desiring
the Congregatioun to pray to God with him for mercy,

"In whatsoever hour ane synner unfeynedlie repenteth, and
turnis from his wickit way, that he will nocht remember

to advert that it excommunicat not those whom God
absolvith.</p>

<p>Yf the offendar callit before the Ministerie be fund stuburne,

than must he be demissed with ane exhortatioun to considder
the dangerus estait in whiche he standis; assuring him, yf thei
find into him no uthir tokin of amendment of lyfe, that thai
will be compelled to seake a farther remedie. Yf he within

must present him to the Churche as before is said.</p>

earnistlie to call to God to move and tuiche the heartis of the

<p>Yf the persoun maligne, than the nixt day of publict assemblie;
the cryme and the persoun must be both notifyed unto

to the nearest freindis of the offendare to travell with him to
bring him to knawledge of himself, and of his dangerus
estait, with ane commandiment gevin to all man to call to
God for the conversioun of the impenitent. Yf ane solempned

then may he be presented to the Churche, and mak his

man signifie his repentence, then aught he to be excommunicat;
and by the mouth of the Minister, consent of the Ministerie,
and commandiment of the Churche, must sick a contempnar
be pronunced excommunicat from God, and from the
societie of his Churche.</p>

<p>After whiche sentence may no persoun, (his wife and familie
onlie excepted,) have ony kynde of conversatioun with him,
be it in eiting and drinking, buying or selling, yea, in saluting
or talking with him; except that it be at the commandiment

<p>We have spokin no thing of those that commit horrible

of the Churche used aganis him, in the same maner as the
personis that for obstinat impenitence ar publictlie excommunicat:
So that the obstinat impenitent efter the sentence of
excommunicatioun, and the murtherar or adulterar stand in
one case as concernying the judgement of [the Churche]; that
is, neathir of both may be receaved in the fellowschip of the
Churche to prayeris or sacramentis, (but to heiring of the
word thei may,) till first thei offer thame selfis to the Ministerie,
humblie requiring the Ministeris and Elderis to pray to
God for thame; and alsua to be intercessouris to the Churche,
that thei may be admitted to publict repentence, and so to

<p>Yf this requeist be humilie maid, then may not the Ministeris

and sa to mak ane publict satisfactioun to the Churche of God.
Whiche day the offenderis must appeare in presence of the
hoill Churche, and with his awin mouthe dampne his awin
impietie, publictlie confessing the same; desiring God of his
grace and mercy, and his congregatioun, that it will please
thame to accept him in thair societie, as before is said. The
Minister must examinat him diligentlie whethir he find a

him, to se what hope he hath of Goddis mercy.</p>

<p>And gif he find him reasonabillie instructed in the knawledge
of Christ Jesus, in the virtu of his death; than may the
Minister confort him by Goddis infallibill promisses, and demand
of the Churche yf thei be content to resave that creature
of God, whome Sathan before have drawin in his nettis, in
the societie of thair body, seing that he declairis him self
penitent. Whiche yf the Churche grant, as thai may not
justlie deny the same, than aught the Minister in publict
prayer to commend him to God, confesse the syn of that offendar,
and of the whole<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Churche, desiring mercy and grace for

aught to exhort the Churche to resave that penitent brothir
in thair favouris, as thay require God to resave thame selfis,
whan thay have offendit; and in signe of thair consent, the
Elderis and cheaf men of the Churche sall tak the penitent
by the hand, and one or two in name of the whole shall kiss
and imbrace him with all reverence and gravitie, as a member
of Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Whiche being done, the Minister shall exhort the reconcilled<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>

bring him frome that obedience whiche he hath gevin to God,
and to the ordinance of his Sone Christ Jesus. The exhortatioun
being ended, the Minister aught to gif publict thankis
unto God for the conversioun of that thair brothir, and for
the benifittis quhilk we resave by Jesus Christ, praying for
the increase and continewance of the same.</p>

<p>Yf the penitent, efter that he have offered him self to the
Ministerie, or to the Churche, be fund ignorant in the principall
pointis of oure religioun, and cheaflie in the article of
Justificatioun, and of the office of Christ Jesus, than aucht he
to be exactlie instructed before he be receaved: For ane

<p>Yf churcheis<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> be of smaller nomber than that Seniouris and
Deaconis can be chosin frome amangis thame, then may thay
weill be joyned to the nixt adjacent Churche: For the pluralitie
of churcheis, without ministeris and ordour, shall rathir
hurt than edifie.</p>

<p>The electioun of Elderis and Deaconis aught to be used
everie yeare once, (whiche we judge to be most convenient the
first day of August;) least that by long continuance of suche
officiaris, men presume upoun the libertie of the Churche. It
hurtis not that one man be reteaned in office mo yearis than
one, so that he be appointed yearlie, by common and fre
electioun; provideit alwayes, that the Deaconis, thesauraris,
be not compelled to receave the office againe for the space of
three yearis.</p>

<p>How the voitis and suffreigeis may be best receaved, so that
everie man may gyf his vote frelie, everie severall Churche
may tack such ordour as best seameth to thame.</p>

<p>The Elderis being elected, must be admonischeit of thair
office, which is to assist the Minister in all publict effares of
the Churche; to wit, in judgeing and decernyng<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> causses; in
geving of admonitioun to the licentious lever; in having of
respect to the manneris and conversatioun of all men within
thair charge; for by the gravitie of the Seniouris aught the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
licht and unbridillit life of the licentious be corrected and
bridillit.</p>

<p>Yea, the Seniouris aught to tak heyde to the life, manneris,
deligence, and studye of thair Ministeris. Yf he be worthie of
admonitioun, thei must admonische him; of correctioun, thei
must correct him: And yf he be worthy of depositioun, thay
with consent of the Churche and Superintendent may depose
him, so that his cryme so deserve. Yf a Minister be licht in
conversatioun, by his Elderis and Seniouris, he aught to be
admonisched. Yf he be negligent in studie, or one that vaketh
not upoun his charge and flocke, or one that proponeth not
frutefull doctrine, he deservith scharpear admonitioun and correctioun.
To the whiche yf he be fund stubburne and inobedient,
than may the Seniouris of one Churche complaine to the
Ministerie of the two nixt adjacent churcheis, whaire men
of greater gravitie are; to whois admonitioun yf he be fund
inobedient, he aught to be discharged frome his ministerie till
his repentence appeare, and a place be vaking for him.</p>

<p>Yf any Minister be deprehendit in any notable cryme, as
huredome, adulterie, murther, man-slauchter, perjurie, teaching
of heresie, or ony such as deserve death, or [that] may be
ane note of perpetuall infamye, he aught to be deposed for ever.
By Heresie, we meane pernitius doctrine planelie taught, and
obstinatlie defended, aganis the foundatioun and principallis of
our faith: and such a cryme we juge to deserve perpetuall depositioun
frome the ministrie; for most dangerus we know it
to be, to commit the flock to ane man infected with the pestilence
of heresye.</p>

<p>Some crymes deserve depositioun for ane tyme, and whill
the persoun gyf declaratioun of gretar gravitie and honnestie:
as yf a minister be deprehendit dronk, in brawling or fechting,
ane oppin sklanderar, ane infamer of his nychtbour, factious
and sawar of discord, be may be commandit to cease from his
ministrie, till he declair the signis of repentence; upoun the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
whiche, the Churche sall abide him the space of twentye dayis
or farther, as the Churche shall think expedient, before that
thay proceed to ane new electioun.</p>

<p>Everie inferiour Churche shall by one of thair Seniouris and
one of thair Deaconis, onis in the year, notifie unto the
ministerie of the Superintendentis churche, the life, maneris,
studye, and deligence of thair Ministeris, to the end that the
discretioun of some may correct the lenitie of otheris.</p>

<p>Not onlie may the life and maneris of the Ministeris cum
under censure and judgement of the Churche, bot also of
thair wiffes, children, and familie; judgement must be tackin,
that he neather live riotuslie, neathir yit avaritiuslie; yea,
respect must be had how thay spend the stipend appointed
to thair leving. Yf ane reasonabill stypend be appointed, and
thay leve avariciuslie, thai must be admonisched to live so as
thay resave; for as excesse and superfluitie is nocht tollerabill
in ane minister, so is avarice and the cairfull sollicitude
of money and geir<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> utterlie to be damned in Christis servandis,
and especialie in those that are fed upoun the charge of the
Church. We judge it unseamlie and not tollerabill that ministeris
shall be burdeit in commoun aill-housses or tavernis.</p>

<p>Neathir yit must ane Minister be permitted to frequent and
commonlie hant the Court, onless it be for a time, when he
is eathir send be the Churche, eathir yit called for by the
Authoritie for his counsall and judgement. Neathir yit must
he be one of the counsall in Civill effaires, be he never judgeit
so apt for that purpose; but eathir must he cease frome the
ministerie (whiche at his awin plesour he may not do,) or ellis
from bearing charge in Civill effaires, onles it be to assist the
Parliament yf he be<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> called.</p>

<p>The office of the Deaconis, as is before declared, is to receave
the rentis, and gadder the almous of the Churche, to keip and
distribute the same, as by the ministerie of the Kirk shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
appointed. Thay may also assist in judgement with the
Ministeris and Elderis, and may be admitted to read in the
assemblie yf thei be required, and be fund abill thairto.</p>

<p>The Elderis and Deaconis, with thair wiffeis and houshaldis
must be under the same censure that is prescribit for the
Ministeris: for thay must be cairfull over thair office; and
seing that thay ar judgeis to the maneris of uthiris, thair
awin conversatioun aught to be irreprehensible: Thay must
be sober, humill, luifaris and interteinaris of concord and peace;
and, finalie, thay aught to be the exempill of godlines till
otheris. And yf the contrarie thairof appeare, thay must be
admonisched by the Minister, or by some of thair brethren of
the ministerie, yf the falt be secreit; and gif it be oppin and
knawin, it must be rebucked before the ministerie, and the
same ordour keipit against the Seniour or Deacon, that before
is describit aganis the Minister.</p>

<p>We think it nott necessarie that ony publict stypend shall
be appointed, eathir to the Elderis, or yit to the Deaconis, becaus
thair travell contineuis bot for ane yeare; and alsua
becaus that thay are not so occupyed with the effares of the
Churche, but that reasonabillie thay may attend upoun thair
domesticall besynes.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Nnyt Heade, concernyng the Polecie of the
Churche.</span><a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polecie</span> we call ane exercise of the Churche<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> in suche
thingis as may bring the rude and ignorant to knawledge, or
ellis inflambe the learned to greater fervencie, or to reteane
the Churche in gude ordour. And thairof thair be two sortis:
the one utterlie necessarie; as that the word be treulie preched,
the sacramentis richtlie ministrat, common prayeris publictlie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
maid; that the children and rude personis be instructed in the
cheaf pointis of religioun, and that offences be corrected and
punisched; these thingis, we say, be so necessarie, that without
the same thair is no face of ane visible Kirk. The other is
proffitable, bot not of mere necessitie; as, that Psalmes suld be
sung; that certane placis of the Scripturis suld be red whan
thair is no sermon; that this day or that day, few or many in
the weeke, the churche suld assemble. Off these and suche
utheris we can not se how ane certane ordour can be establisched.
For in some churcheis the Psalmes may be convenientlie
sung; in utheris, perchance, thay can not. Some
churcheis may convene everie day; some thryise or twise in
the weeke; some perchance bot onis. In these and such like
must everie particular Churche, by thair awin consent, appoint
thair awin Polecie.</p>

<p>In greit Tounis we think expedient that everie day thair be
eathir Sermon, or ellis Common Prayeris, with some exercise
of reiding the Scripturis. What day the publict Sermon is,
we can neathir require or gretlie approve that the Commoun
Prayeris be publictlie used, least that we shall eathir fostar
the peple in superstitioun, wha come to the Prayeris as thay
come to the Messe; or ellis give thame occasioun to think that
those be no prayeris whiche ar maid before and efter Sermon.</p>

<p>In everie notable Toun, we require that one day besydis the
Sunday, be appointed to the Sermone and Prayeris; whiche,
during the tyme of Sermone, must be keipit fre frome all exercise
of laubour, alsweill of the maister as of the servandis.
In smaller tounis, as we have said, the commoun consent of
the Churche must put ordour. But the Sunday must straitlie
be keipit, both before and efter noon, in all tounis. Before
noon, must the word be preached and sacramentis ministered,
as also Mariage solempnissed, yf occasioun offer: After noon
must the young children be publictlie examinated in thair
Catechisme in audience of the pepill, in doing whairof the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Minister must tak gret deligence, alsweill to cause the Pepill
to understand the questionis proponed, as the ansueiris, and
the doctrine that may be collected thairof. The ordour<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> and
how much is appointed for everie Sunday, is alreaddy distinctit
in oure buke of Common Ordour;<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> whiche Catechism
is the most perfite that ever yit was used in the Churche.
At efter noon also may Baptisme be ministered, whan occasioun
is offered of great travell before noon. It is also to be
observit, that prayeris be used at after noon upoun the Sunday,
whair thair is neathir preching nor catechisme.</p>

<p>It apperteaneth to the Policie of the Churche to appoint the
tymes whan the Sacramentis shall be ministered. Baptisme
may be ministrat whensoever the word is preached; but we
think it more expedient, that it be ministered upoun the
Sunday, or upoun the day of prayeris, onlie after the sermon;
partlie to remove this gross errour by the which many deceaved,
think<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> that children be dampned yf thay die without
Baptisme; and partlie to mak the people assist the administratioun
of that sacrament with greater reverence than thei
do.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> For we do see the people begyn alreddie to wax weary
be reasoun of the frequent repetitioun of those promisses.</p>

<p>Foure tymes in the yeare we think sufficient to the administratioun
of the Lordis Tabill, which we desire to be distincted,
that the superstitioun of tymes may be avoided so
far as may be. Your Honouris ar nocht ignorant how superstitiouslie
the people ryn to that actioun at Pasche, evin as
[if] the tyme gave virtue to the Sacrament; and how the rest
of the hoill yeare thai ar cairles and negligent, as [if] that it apperteaneth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
not unto thame but at that tyme onlie. We think
thairfore most expedient, that the first Sunday of Marche be
appointed for one [time]; the first Sunday of Junij for ane
uther; the first Sunday of September for the thrid; and the
first Sunday of December for the fourt. We do not deny but
that any severall churche, for reasonable causses, may change
the tyme, and may minister ofter; but we study to suppresse<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>
superstitioun. All Ministeris must be admonisched to be
more cairfull to instruct the ignorant than readdie to satisfie<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>
thair appetiteis, and more scharp in examinatioun then
indulgent, in admitting to that great Mysterie<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> such as
be ignorant of the use and virtu of the same: and thairfore
we think that the administratioun of the Table aught never
to be without that examinatioun pass before, especiallie of
those whose knawledge is suspect. We think that none ar
apt to be admitted to that Mysterie who can not formalie
say the Lordis Prayer, the Articles of the Beleif, and declair
the soume of the Law.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p>Farthir, we think it a thing most expedient and necessarie,
that everie Churche have a Bibill in Inglische, and that the
people be commanded to convene to heir the plane reiding or
interpretatioun of the Seripturis, as the Churche shall appoint;
that be frequent reiding this gross ignorance, whiche in the
cursit Papistrie hath overflowne all, may partlie be removit.
We think it most expedient that the Seripturis be red in ordour,
that is, that some one buke of the Auld and the New
Testament be begun and ordourlie red to the end. And the
same we judge of preching, whair the Minister for [the]
maist part remaneth in one place: For this skipping and
divagatioun frome place to place of the Scripture, be it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
reiding, or be it in precheing, we judge not so proffitabill to
edifie the Churche, as the continewall following of ane text.</p>

<p>Everie Maister of houshald must be commandit eathir to
instruct, or ellis caus [to] be instructed, his children, servandis,
and familie, in the principallis of the Christiane religioun;
without the knawledge whairof aught none to be admitted to
the Tabill of the Lord Jesus: for suche as be so dull and so
ignorant, that thei can neathir try thame selfis, neathir yit
know the dignitie and misterie of that actioun, can not eat
and drink of that Tabill worthelie. And thairfore of necessitie
we judge it, that everie yeare at least, publict examinatioun be
had by the Ministeris and Elderis of the knawledge of everie
persoun within the Churche; to wit, that everie maister and
maistres of houshald cum thame selvis and thair familie so
many as be cum to maturitie, before the Ministeris and Elderis,
to gyf confessioun of thair faith, and to ansueir to such cheaf
points of Religioun as the Ministeris shall demand. Such as
be ignorant in the Articulis of thair Faith;<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> understand not,
nor can not rehearse the Commandimentis of God; knaw not
how to pray; neathir whairinto thair richtuousnes consistis,
aught not to be admitted to the Lordis Tabill. And gif thay
stuburnlie continew,<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> and suffer thair children and servandis
to continew in wilfull ignorance, the discipline of the Churche
must proceid against them unto excommunicatioun; and than
must the mater be referred to the Civill Magistrat. For seing
that the just levith be his awin faith, and that Christ Jesus
justifieth be knawledge off him self, insufferable we judge it
that men shall be permitted to leve and continew in ignorance
as memberis of the Churche of God.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, men, wemen, and children wald be exhorted to
exercise thame selvis in the Psalmes, that when the Churche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
convenith, and dois sing, thai may be the more abill togither
with commoun heart and voice to prayse God.</p>

<p>In private housses we think it expedient, that the most
grave and discreate persoun use the Commoun Prayeris at
morne and at nycht, for the confort and instructioun of uthiris.
For seing that we behald and se the hand of God now presentlie
striking us with diverse plagues, we think it ane contempt
of his judgementis, or ane provocatioun of his anger
more to be kendillit against us, yf we be not movit to repentence
of oure formar unthankfulnes, and to earnist invocatioun
of His name, whois onlie power may, (and great mercy will,)
yff we unfeynedlie convert unto him, remove from us these
terribill plagues whiche now for our iniquiteis hing oure our
headis. "Convert us, O Lord, and we shall be converted."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">For Preacheing,<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> and Interpreting off Scripturis, &amp;c.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote10">1 Cor. 14:29</div>

<p>To the end that the Churche of God may have a tryell
of mennis knawledge, judgementis, gracis, and utterancis; and
also, that suche as somewhat have proffited in Goddis worde,
may from tyme to tyme grow to more full perfectioun to
serve the Churche, as necessitie shall require: it is most expedient
that in everie Toune, whaire Schollis and repair of learned
Men ar, that thair be one certane day everie weake appointed
[to] that Exercise, which Sanct Paull calleth prophecieing;
the ordour whairof is expressed by him in these words:
"Let two or thre propheitis speik; and lat the rest judge:
But yf any thing be reveilled to him that sitteth by, lat the
formar keip silence: [For] ye may, one by one, all prophecie,
that all may learn, and all may receave consolatioun. And the
Spreittis (that is, the judgementis) of the Propheitis, are subject
to the propheitis." Off whiche wordis of the Apostle, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
evident that in Corinthus, whan the Churche did assemble<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>
for that purpose, sum place of Scripture was red; upoun the
whiche, first one gyf his judgement to the instructioun and
consolatioun of the auditouris; after whome did one uthir
eathir conferme what the formare had said, or did add what
he had omitted, or did gentillie correct or explane more properlie
whair the hoill veritie was not reveilled to the formar.
And in case sum thingis war hid frome the one and frome the
uthir, libertie was gevin to the thrid to speik his judgement
for edificatioun of the Churche. Above the whiche nomber
of three, (as appereth,) thay passed not, for avoiding of confusioun.</p>

<p>These Exercisses, we say, ar thingis most necessarie for the
Churche of God this day in Scotland; for thairby (as said is)
shall the Churche have judgement and knawledge of the
gracis, giftis, and utterances of everie man within thair awin
body; the simple, and suche as have sumwhat proffited, shall
be encurageit dalie to study and proceid in knawledge; the
Churche shall be edifyed; (for this Exercise must be patent to
suche as list to heir and learne,) and everie man shall have
libertie to utter and declair his mynd and knawledge to the
confort and edificatioun of the Churche.</p>

<p>But least that of a profitable Exercise mycht aryise<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> debate
and strife, curiouse, peregryne and unprofitable questionis ar
to be avoided. All interpretatioun disaggreing from the principallis
of oure faith, repugnyng to cheritie, or that standis in
plane contradictioun to ony uthir manifest place of Scripture,
is to be rejected. The Interpretour in that exercise, may nocht
tack to him self the libertie of ane publict Precheour, yea,
althocht he be a Minister appointed; but he must bind him
self to his text, that he enter not by disgressioun in explanyng
commoun places. He may use no invective in that exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
onles it be with sobrietie in confuting heresyes. In exhortationis
or admonitionis he must be schorte, that the tyme may
be spent in oppenyng of the mynd of the Holy Ghost in that
place; in following the fyle<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> and dependence of the text, and
in observing suche notes as may instruct and edifie the auditour.
For avoyding of contentioun, neathir may the interpretour,
neathir yit any of the assemblie, move any questioun in
oppen audience, whairto him self is not content<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> to geve resolutioun
without reasoning with any other; but everie man
ought to speik his awin judgement to the edificatioun of the
Churche.</p>

<p>Yf any be noted with curiositie, or bringyng in any strange
doctrine, he must be admonished by the Moderatouris, the
Ministeris and Eldaris, immediatlie after that the interpretatioun
is ended. The hoill memberis,<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> and nomber of thame
that ar of the Assemblie, ought to convene togetther, whair
examinatioun should be had, how the persones that did interprete
did handle and convey the mater; thei thame selffis being
removed till every man have gevin his censure; after the
whiche, the persones being called, the faultes (yf any notable
be found) ar noted, and the persone gentillie admonished.
In that last Assemblie all questionis and dowtis, (yf any
arryise,) should be resolved without contentioun.</p>

<p>The Ministeris of the Paroche churches to Landwarte, adjacent
to everie cheaf toune, and the Readaris, gif thai have
any gift of interpretatioun, within sex myles must assist and
concur to those that prophecie within the townes; to the end
that thei thame selves may eather learne, or ellis utheris may
learne be thame. And moreover, men in whome ar supposed
any giftis to be, which mycht edifie the Churche yf thei war
weall apply ed, must be charged by the Ministeris and Eldaris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to joyne thame selfis with that sessioun and cumpany of Interpretouris,
to the end that the Churche may judge whether
thei be able to serve to Goddis glorie, and to the proffeit of
the Churche in the vocatioun of Ministeris or not. And yf
any be found disobedient, and not willing to communicat the
giftis and spirituall graces<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> of God with thair brethren, after
sufficient admonitioun, discipline must procead against thame;
provided that the Civile Magistrate concur with the judgement
and electioun of the Churche. For no man may be permitted
to leave<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> as best pleasseth him within the Churche of God;
but everie man must be constrayned, by fraterall admonitioun
and correctioun, to bestow his laubouris, when of the Churche
thei ar required, to the edificatioun of otheris.</p>

<p>What day in the week is most convenient for that exercise,
and what bookes of the Scripturis salbe most profitable to be
red, we refer to the judgment of everie particulare Churche,
we meane, to the wisdome of the Ministeris and Eldaris.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Of Mariage.</span><a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p>Becaus that Mariage, the blessed ordinance of God, in this
cursed Papistrie hath partlie bene contempned; and partlie
hath bene so infirmed, that the personis conjoyned could never
be assured of continewance,<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> yf the Bischoppis and Prelattis
list to dissolve the same; we have thocht goode to schaw oure
judgmentis how such confusioun in tymes cuming may be
best avoyded.</p>

<p>And first publict inhibitioun must be maid, that na personis

which thei judge to be of God, may be performed. Yf the
father, friend, or maister, ganestand thair requeast, and have
na other caus then the commoun sorte of men have; to wit,
lack of guidis, or because thei ar nott so hyght-borne as thai
requyre; yit must not the pairteis whose heartis ar tweiched
mak ony covenant till farther declaratioun be maid unto
the Churche of God. And, thairfoir, efter thei have opened
thair myndis to thair parentis, or suche otheris as have charge
oure thame, thei must declair it also to the Ministrie, or to
the Civile Magistrat, requyring thame to travaill with thair
parentis for thair consent, whiche to do thei ar bound. And
yf thei, to wit, the Magistrate or Ministeris, fynd no just caus
why the mariage requyred may not be fulfilled, then efter
sufficient admonitioun to the father, friend, maister, or superiour,
that none of thame resist the work of God, the Ministerie
or Magistrat may enter in the place of the parent, and by
consenting to thair just requeastis may admit thame to
mariage: for the work of God aught not to be hyndered by
the corrupt affectionis of worldlie men. The work of God we
call, when two heartis (without filthynes befoir committit) ar
so joyned, that boyth requyre and ar content to live together
in that holy band of Matrimonye.</p>

<p>Yf any man commit fornicatioun with the woman whome
he requyred in mariage, then do boyth lose this foirsaid benefite
alsweall of the Churche as of the Magistrat; for neather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of boyth aught to be intercessouris or advocattis for fylthie
fornicatours. But the father, or neyrest friend, whose dowghter
being a virgine is deflored, hath power by the law of God to
compell the man that did that injurie to marie his dowghtter;
or yf the father will not accept him be reassone of his offense,
then may he requyre the dote<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> of his dowghter; whiche yf the
offendar be nott able to pay, then aught the Civile Magistrat
to punishe his body by some other punishement.</p>

<p>And becaus that fornicatioun, huredome, and adulterye, ar
synnes most commoun in this Realme, We requyre of your
Honouris, in the name of the Eternall God, that severe
punishement, according as God hath commanded, be executed
against suche wicked offendaris;<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> for we doubt not but suche

God, as the Apostle speaketh, not onlie upoun the offendaris,

thei ar committed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AGGREIS
TO THE
HEAD OF
MARIAGE.</div>

<p>But to returne to oure formar purpose: Mariage owght not
to be contracted amongis personis that have no electioun for
lack of understanding; and thairfoir we affirm, that bairns and
infantis can nocht lauchfullie be mareid in thair minor aige,
to wit, the man within fourtene yeiris of aige, and the woman
within twelf yearis, at the least. Whiche yf it chance any to
have bene, and have keapt thair bodyis always separat, we can
not judge thame bound to adhear as man and wyiff, by reassone
of that promeis, which in Goddis presence was no promeise
at all. But yf in the yearis of judgment thai have embrased
the one the other, then be reassone of thair last consent,
thai have ratifeid that which otheris did promeise for thame
in thair youth-head.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>In a Reformed Churche, Mariage ought nott to be secreatlie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
used, but in open face and publict audience of the Churche:
And for avoyding of dangearis, expedient it is that the bannes
be publictlie proclamed thre Sundayis, (onles the persones be
[so] knawin, that no suspitioun of dangear may arise, and
then may the bannes<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> be schortned at the discretioun of the
Ministerie.) But in no wyse can we admitt Mariage to be
used secreatlie, how honorable that ever the personis be.
The Sunday befoir sermon we think most convenient<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> for
mariage, and it to be used no day ellis without the consent of
the hoill Ministerie.</p>

<p>Mariage once lauchfullie contracted, may not be dissolved
at manis pleasour, as oure maister Christ Jesus doeth witnesse,
onles adulterie be committed; which being sufficientlie proven
in presence of the Civil Magistrat, the innocent (yf thei so
requyre) ought to be pronunced frie, and the offendar aught
to suffer the death as God hath commanded. Yf the Civile
sweard foolischelie spair the lyeff of the offendar, yit may not
the Churche be negligent in thair office, which is to excommunicat
the wicked, and to repute thame as dead memberis, and
to pronunce the innocent partie to be at freedome, be thei
never so honourabile befoir the warld. Yf the lyfe be spared
(as it ought not to be) to the offendaris, and gif the fructis of
repentance of long tyme appeir in thame, and gif thai earnestlie
desyre to be reconceilled with the Churche, we judge that
thai may be receaved to participatioun of the Sacramentis,
and of the other benefits of the Churche, (for we wold not that
the Churche sould hold those excommunicat whom God absolved,
that is, the Penitent.)</p>

<p>Yf any demand, whether that the offendar after reconciliatioun
with the Churche, may not marye agane? We answer,
That yf thai can not leve continent, and yf the necessitie be
suche as that thai fear farther offence of God, we can not forbid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
thame to use the remeady ordayned of God. Yf the
partie offended, may be reconcilled to the offendar, then we
judge that in nowyse it shall be lauchfull to the offendar to
mary any other, except the partie that befoir hath bene offended;
and the solempnizatioun of the latter mariage must be in
the open face of the Churche lyke as the formare, but without
proclamatioun of banns.</p>

<p>This we do offer as the best Counsall that God geveth unto
us in so doubtsome a case. But the most perfyte Reformatioun
war, yf your Honouris wald give to God his honour and glorie,
that ye wold prefer his expresse commandiment to your awin
corrupt judgmentis, especially in punisheing of those crymes
whiche he commandeth to be punished with death. For so
should ye declair your selfis Godis treu and obedient officiaris,
and your Commoun-wealth should be redd of innumerable
trubles.</p>

<div class="sidenote10"><i>NOTA</i></div>

<p>We meane not, that synnes committed in our formar blyndnes,
(whiche be almost buried in oblivioun,) salbe callit agane
to examinatioun and judgment. But we requyre that the law
may now and heirafter be so establisched and executed, that

<p>For avoyding all inconvenientis,<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> we judge it best, that
neather singing nor reading be at the Buryall: for albeit
thingis song and red may admonishe some of the leving to prepair
thame selfis for death, yit shall some superstitious and

reading of the levying do and may proffat the dead. And
thairfoir, we think most expedient that the Dead be convoyed
to the place of buriall with some honest cumpany of the
Churche, without eather singing or reading; yea, without all
kynd of ceremony heirtofore used, uther than that the dead be
committed to the grave, with suche gravitie and sobrietie, as
those that be present may seame to fear the judgmentis of
God, and to hate synne, whiche is the caus of death.</p>

<div class="sidenote10">ADDITIO.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></div>

<p><span class="smcap">And yit, nochtwithstanding, we are not so precise, but
that we ar content that particular Kirkis use thame in

same, as thei will answeir to God, and Assemblie of the
Universall Kirk gathered within the Realme.</span></p>

<p>We ar nott ignorant that some requyre ane Sermone at the
Buriall, or ellis some places of Scripturis to be red, to put the
leving in mynd that thei ar mortall, and that lykwyise thei
must dye. Bot lett those men understand, that the sermonis
whiche be daily maid, serve for that use; whiche yf men dispyse,
the preaching of the<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> Funerall sermonis shall rather
nureise superstitioun and a false opinioun, (as befoir is said,)
then that thei shall bring suche persones to any godlie consideratioun
of thair awin estaite. Attour, eather shall the
Ministeris for the most parte be occupyed in preaching Funerall
sermonis, or ellis thei shall have respect to personis, preaching
at the buriall of the rich and honorabill, but keaping silence

<p>In respect of diverse inconvenientis, we think it neather

of the Sacramentis shalbe maid a place of Buriall; but
that some other secreat and convenient place, lying in the

<p>As Sathan hath never ceassed frome the begyning to draw
mankynd in one of two extremiteis, to wit, that men should
eathir be so ravished with gazing upoun the visible creaturis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
that forgetting the caus why thai war ordeyned,<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> thai attributed

and dispyse Godis blessed ordinance and holy institutionis, as
[if] that neathir in the rycht use of thame war thair any
proffeit, neathir yit in thair prophanatioun war thair any danger.
As this wyese, we say, Sathan hath blynded the most
parte of mankynd from the begyning; so doubt we not, but
that he will stryve to continew in his malice evin to the end.
Oure eyis have seane, and presentlie do see the experience of
the one and of the other. What was the opinioun of most
parte of men, of the Sacrament of Christis bodie and bloode,
during the darknes of superstitioun, is not unknawin, how it
was gazed upoun, kneeled unto, borne in processioun, and
finallie wirschipped and honored as Christ Jesus him selve.
And so long as Sathan mycht thane reteane man in that
damnable idolatrie, he was quyet, as one that possessed his
kingdome of darknes peceablie. But since that it hath pleased
the mercyis of God to reveill unto the unthankfull world
the lyght of his wourd, the rycht use and administratioun of
his sacramentis, he assayis man upoun the contrarie parte.
For whair, (not lang ago,) men stude in suche admiratioun of

and some idiottis, (yit more wickedlie and more

treu Ministeris do in the open congregatioun; thei presume,
(we say,) to do it in housses without reverence, without word
preached, and without Minister, other then of companioun to

<div class="sidenote">OPTIMA COLLATIO.</div>

<p>We dare not prescribe unto you what penalties shalbe required

<p>The Papisticall Preastis have neather power nor authoritie

<p>That we require the Churche to be set at suche libertie,

how potentlie God hath performed, in these our last and wicked
dayis, alsweall as in the aiges that have passed befoir us, the
promisses that is maid to the servandis of God, by the propheite
Esais, in these wordis:&mdash;"Thei that waite upoun the
Lord shall renewe thair strenth; thei sall lift up the wynges as
the egles: thei shall runne, and not be wearie; thei shall walke,
and not fainte." This promeise, we say, suche as Sathan hath
not utterlie blyndit may see performed in us, the professouris
of Christ Jesus, within this Realme of Scotland, with no les
evidencye, than it was in any aige that ever have passed befoir
us. For what was oure force? What was our nomber? Yea,
what wisdome or warldlie pollicey was into us, to have brought
to ane goode end so great ane interpryse? Oure verray
enemyes can bear witnesse. And yit in how great puritie
God did establisse amanges us his treu Religioun, alsweall
in doctrine as in ceremonyes! To what confusion and fear war
idolateris, adulteraris, and all publict transgressoris of Goddis
commandimentis, within short tyme brought? The publict
ordour of the Churche,<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> yet by the mercy of God preserved, and
the punishmentis executed against malefactouris, can testifie
unto the world. For as tueching the doctrine taught by our
Ministeris, and as tueching the administratioun of Sacramentis
used in our Churches, we ar bold to affirme, that thair is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
realme this day upoun the face of the earth, that hath thame
in grettar puritie;&mdash;yea, (we mone speak the treuth whomesoever
we offend,) thair is none (no realme, we meane) that
hath thame in the lyek puritie: For all otheris (how synceare
that ever the doctrine be, that by some is taught,) reteane in
thair churches, and the ministeris thairof, some footsteppis of
Antichrist, and some<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> dreggis of Papistrie;<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> but we (all praise
to God alone) have no thing within oure Churches that ever
flowed frome that Man of synne: And this we acknowledge to
be the strenth gevin unto us by God, because we esteamed
nott our selves wyise in oure awin eyes, but understanding our
hoill wisdome to be but meare foolishnes, befoir [the Lord]
our God, layed it asyd, and followed onlie that whiche we fand
approved by him self.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FIRST
PETITIOUN
OF THE PROTESTANTIS
OF SCOTLAND.</div>

<p>In this poynt could never our enemyes caus us to fainte, for
Our first Petitioun was, "That the reverent face of the primitive
and apostolick Churche should be reduced agane to the
eyes and knowledge of men."<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> And in that poynt, we say, our
God hath strenthened us till that the work was finished, as
the world may see. And as concerning the suppressing of
vice, yea, and of the abolishing of all suche thingis as myght
nureise impietie within the Realme, the actes and statutis of
the principale Townes reformed will yitt testifie: For what
adulterar, what fornicatour, what knawin messe-mongare, or
pestilent Papist, durst have been seen in publict, within any
reformed town within this Realme, befoir that the Quene
arryved? And this victorie to his wourde, and terrour to all
fylthie lyvaris, did oure God wirk by such as yit leave and
remaine witnesses (whither thei will or not) of the foirsaid
workis of our God. We say, our God suffered none of those
whome he first called to the battell, to perishe or to fall, till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
that he maid thame victouris of thair ennemyes: For evin as
God suffered none of those whome he called frome Egypt to
perishe in the Red Sea, how fearfull that ever the danger
appeared; so suffered he none of us to be oppressed, nor yit to
be takkin from this lyeff, till that mo Pharaoes then one war
drowned, and we set at fredome, without all dangear of our
ennemyes; to lett boyth us and our posteritie understand, that
suche as follow the conducting of God can not perishe, albeit
that thei walked in the verray schaddo of death.</p>

<p>But frome whence (allace) cumeth this miserable dispersioun

to keap silence? good men ar banished, murtheraris, and such
as ar knowin unworthie of the commoun societie, (yf just lawis
war put in deu executioun,) bear the hoill regiment and

the most parte of us declyned from the puritie of
Goddis word, and began to follow the warld; and so agane to
schaik handis with the Devill, and with idolatrie, as in this
Fourte Booke we will hear.</p>


<p>For whill that Papistis war so confounded, that none within
the Realme durst more avow the hearing or saying of Messe,
then the theavis of Lyddesdaill durst avow thair stowth in presence
of ane upryght judge, thair war Protestants found, that
eschamed not at tables, and other open places, to ask, "Why
may nott the Queyn have hir awin<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> Messe, and the forme of

from these two, "Why" and "What," at lenthe sprange out
this affirmative, "The Quenis Messe and hir Preastis will we
manteine: this hand and this rapper sall feght in thair
defence, etc."</p>

<p>The inconvenientis war schawin, both by tongue and pen;
but the advertissaris war judged to be men of unquyet spreatis.
Thair credytt was defaced at the handis of suche as befoir war
not eschamed to have used thair counsall, in materis of greattar
importance then to have resisted the Messe. But then, my
Lord, my Maister, may nott be thus used: he hes that honour
to be the Quenis brother; and thairfoir we will that all men
shall understand that he man tender her as his sister; and
whosoever will counsall him to displease her, or the least that
apperteanes unto hir, shall not find him thair freind; yea, thei

AND THAIR
REASSONIS.</div>

<p>These and the lyke reassonis took suche deape roote in
flesche and bloode, that the trewth of God was almost foryett;
and from this fontaine (to wit, that flesche and blood was, and
yitt allace, is preferred to God, and to his messengeris rebucking
vice and vanitie) hath all our miserie proceeded. For
as befoir, so even yitt, althought the Ministeris be sett to beg,
the Guard and the Men of war maun be served. Though the
blood of the Ministeris be spylt, it is the Quenis servand that
did it. Althought Messes be multipleyed in all quarteris of
the Realme, who can stop the Quenis subjectis to lyve of the
Quenis religioun. Althought innocent men be empreasoned,
it is the Quenis pleasur: sche is offended at such men. Althought
under pretence of justice innocentis be crewellie murthered;
the Lordis shall weape, but the Quenis mynd must
be satisfeid. Nobillis of the Realme, Baronis and Counsallouris
ar banished, thair eschaittis disponed, and thair lyves
maist injustlie persewed. The Quene hes lost hir trusty servand
Davy: he was dear unto hir; and thairfoir, for hir
honouris sake, sche maun schaw rigour to revenge his death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
And yit farther, albeit that some know that sche hes plainlie
purposed to wrak the religioun within this Realme; that to
that Romane Antichrist sche hath maid hir promeise; and
that from him sche hath tackin money to uphold his pompe
within this Realme; yit will thai lett the people understand,
that the Quene will establisse religioun, and provide all thingis

<p>With great diligence<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> the Lordis repared unto hir from all
quarters. And so was nothing understand<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> but myrth and
quyetness till the nixt Sunday, which was the xxiiij of August,
when preparatioun began to be maid for that idoll the Messe to
be said in the Chapell; which perced the hartis of all. The
godlie<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> began to bolden; and men began openlie to speak,
"Shall that idoll be suffered agane to tack place within this
Realm? It shall not." The Lord Lyndesay, (then but Maister,)<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>
with the gentilmen of Fyiff, and otheris, plainlie cryed in
the close, "The idolater Preast should dye the death," according
to Goddis law. One that caryed in the candell was
evill effrayed; but then began flesche and blood to schaw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
self. Thair durst no Papist, neathir yitt any that cam out of
France whisper. But the Lord James<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> (the man whom all
the godlye did most reverence) took upoun him to keap the
Chapell door. His best excuse was, that he wald stop all
Scotishe men to enter in to the Messe. But it was, and is
sufficientlie known, that the door was keapt, that nane should
have entress to truble the Preast; who, after the Messe, was committed
to the protectioun of Lord Johne of Coldinghame,<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> and
Lord Robert of Halyrudehouse,<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> who then war boyth Protestantis,
and had communicat at the Table of the Lord. Betwix
thame two was the Preast convoyed to his chalmer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE END IS
NOTT YITT
SEANE.</div>

<p>And so the godlie departed with great greaf of heart, and
at after noon repaired to the Abbay in great companeis, and
gave plane significatioun, that thai could not abyd that the
land which God by his power had purged from idolatrie,
should in thair eyes be polluted agane. Which understand,
thair began complaint upoun complaint. The old dounty-bowris,
and otheris that long had served in the Court, and hes
no remissioun of synnes, but by virtew of the Messe, cryed,
"Thai wald to France without delay: thai could not live
without the Messe." The same affirmed the Quenis Uncles.
And wold to God that that menzie, togitther with the Messe,
had tacken good nyght at this Realme for ever; for so had
Scotland bene rydd of ane unprofitable burthen of devouring
strangearis, and of the maledictioun of God that hes stricken,
and yitt will strike for idolatrie.</p>

<p>This baldnes did somewhat exasperat the Quene, and such

thai schew thame selves wonderouslie offended, that the Messe

perceaved, a zealous and godlie man, Robert Campbell of Kingzeancleucht,
said unto the Lord Vchiltrie, "My Lord, now ye

<div class="sidenote">THE COURTEOURIS.</div>

<div class="sidenote">JOHNE KNOX
CONFESSIOUN.</div>

<p>The nixt Sounday, Johnne Knox, inveighing against idolatrie,
schew what terrible plagues God had tacken upoun Realmes
and Nationis for the same; and added, "That one Messe (thair
war no mo suffered at the first) was more fearful to him then
gif ten thousand armed enemyes war landed in any pairte of
the Realme, of purpose to suppress the hoill religioun. For
(said he) in our God thair is strenth to resist and confound
multitudis, yf we unfeanedlie depend upoun him; whairof
heirtofoir we haif had experience; but when we joyne handis
with idolatrie, it is no doubt but that both Godis amicable
presence and confortable defence leaveth us, and what shall
then become of us? Allace, I fear that experience shall teach
us to the greaf of many." At these wordis, the guydaris of
of the Court mocked, and plainlie spak, "That such fear was
no poynt of thair fayth: it was besyd his text, and was a
verray untymelie admonitioun." But we heard this same
Johnne Knox, in the audience of the same men, recyte the
same wordis agane in the myddest of trubles; and in the
audience of many ask God mercy, that he was nott more
vehement and upryght in the suppressing of that idoll in the
begynning. "For, (said he,) albeit that I spack that which
offended some, (which this day thai see and feall to be treu,) yit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
did I not [that] which I myght have done; for God had not onlie
gevin unto me knowledge, and toung to maik the impietie of
that idoll knowin unto this Realme, but he had gevin unto
me credyte with many, who wold have put in executioun Goddis
judgmentis, yf I wold onlie have consented thairto: But so
cairfull was I<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> of that commoun tranquillitie, and so loth was
I to have offended those of whom I had conceaved a good opinioun,
that in secreat conference with earnest and zealous
men, I travaled rather to mitigat, yea, to slokin, that fervencye
that God had kyndled in otheris, than to animat or encorage
thame to put thair handis to the Lordis work: Whairintill I
unfeanedlie acknowledge my selff to have done most wickedlie;
and from the bottom of my hart, askis of my God grace and
pardon, for that I did not what in me lay to have suppressed
that idoll in the begining." These and other wordis did many
hear him speak in publict place, in the moneth of December,
the year of God J<sup>m</sup> V<sup>c</sup> and threscoir fyve yearis, when such as
at the Quenis arryvell onlie manteyned the Masse, war exyled
the Realme, summoned upoun treassone, and decreit of forfaltour
intended against thame. But to return from whence
we have digressed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FIRST
REASSONING
BETWIX
THE QUEYN
AND JOHNE
KNOX.</div>

<p>Whetther it was by counsall of otheris, or of the Quenis
awin desyre, we knaw not; but the Quene spack with Johne
Knox, and had long ressoning with him, none being present
except the Lord James: (two gentilwemen stood<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> in the other
end of the house.) The summe of thair reassoning was this.
The Quene accused him, that he had raysed a part of hir subjectis
against hir Mother, and against hir self: That he had
writtin a book against hir just authoritie, (sche ment the
treatise against the Regiment of Wemen<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>) which sche had,
and should caus the most learned in Europe to wryte against
it: That he was the caus of great seditioun and great slauchter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
in England; and that it was said to hir, that all which he did
was by necromancye, &amp;c.</p>

<p>To the whiche the said Johne answered, "Madam, it may
please your Majestie patientlie to hear my sempill ansures.
And first, (said he,) yf to teach the treuth of God in synceritie,
yf to rebuke idolatrie, and to will a people to wyrschip God
according to his word, be to raise subjectis against thair
Princes, then can not I be excused; for it hes pleased God of
his mercy to mack me ane (amongis many) to disclose unto
this Realme the vanitie of the Papisticall religioun, and the
deceat, pryde, and tyranny of that Romane Antichrist. Bot,
Madam, yf the treu knowledge of God, and his rycht wirschipping
be the cheaf causses, that must move men from thair
heart to obey thair just Princes, (as it is most certane that thai
ar,) whairin can I be reprehended? I think, and am surelie
persuaded, that your Grace have had, and presentlie have, als
unfeaned obedience, of such as profess Jesus Christ within this
Realme, as ever your Father, or other progenitouris had of
those that war called Bischoppis. And tueching that booke,
which seameth so highlie to offend your Majestie, it is most
certane that I wrait it, and am content that all the learned
of the world judge of it. I hear that ane Englishe man
hath writtin against it,<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> but I have not redd him. Yf he
have sufficientlie improved my ressones, and establissed his
contrarie propositioun, with als evident testimonyes as I have
done myne, I shall nott be obstinat, but shall confess my
errour and ignorance. Bot to this hour I have thocht, and
yit thinkis my self allone to be more able to sustene the
thingis affirmed in that my wark, than any ten in Europe
salbe able to confute it."</p>

<p>"Ye think then, (quod sche,) that I have no just authoritie?"</p>

<p>"Pleise your Majestie, (said he,) that learned men in all aiges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
have had thair judgmentis free, and most commonlie disagreing
frome the commoun judgment of the warld; suche also
have thei publisshed, boyth with pen and toung, and yit notwithstanding
thei thame selves have lived in the commoun
societie with otheris, and have borne patientlie with the
errours and imperfectionis whiche thei could not amend.
Plato, the philosopher, wrote his Bookis of the Commounwealth,
in the whiche he dampneth many thingis that then
war manteaned in the world, and required many thingis to
have bene reformed; and yitt, notwithstanding he lived evin
under suche policies, as then war universallie receaved, without
farther trubling of any estait. Evin so, Madam, am I content
to do, in uprightness of heart, and with a testimonye of a good
conscience. I have communicat my judgment to the world:
Yf the Realme fyndis no inconvenience frome the regiment of
a woman, that whiche thei approve shall I not farther disallow,
then within my awin breast, but salbe alse weall content to
lyve under your Grace, as Paull was to lyve under Nero; and
my hope is, that so long as that ye defyle not your handis
with the blood of the sanctis of God, that neather I nor that
Booke shall eather hurt you or your authoritie: for in verray
deed, Madame, that Book was written most especialie against
that wicked Jesabell of England."<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p>

<p>"But (said sche) ye speak of women in generall."</p>

<p>"Most treu it is, Madame, (said the other,) and yit it appeareth
to me that wisdome should persuade your Grace, never
to raise truble for that, whiche to this day hath not trubled
your Majestie, neather in persone nor yit in authoritie. For of
lait yearis, many thingis, whiche befoir war haldin stable, have
bene called in doubt; yea thei have bene plainlie impugned.
But yit, Madame, (said he,) I am assured that neather Protestant
nor Papist shalbe abill to prove, that any suche questioun
was at any time moved in publict or in secreat. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Madam, (said he,) yf I had intended to have trubled your
estaite, becaus ye ar a woman, I myght have chosen a tyme
more convenient for that purpose, then I can do now, when
your awin presence is within the Realme.</p>

<p>"But now, Madam, schortlie to ansuer to the other two
accusationis. I hartlie praise my God, throwgh Jesus Christ,
that Sathan the ennemye of mankynd, and the wicked of the
world, have no other crymes to lay to my charge, then suche
as the verray world it self knoweth to be most fals and vane.
For in England I wes resident onlie the space of fyve yearis.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>
The places war Berwick, whair I abode two yearis; so long in
the New Castell; and a year in London. Now, Madam, yf in
any of these places, during the tyme that I wes thair, any
man salbe able to prove, that thair wes eather battell, seditioun,
or mutinie, I shall confesse that I my selff was the
malefactour, and the scheddar of the bloode. I eschame not,
Madam, farther to affirme, that God so blissed my waik laubouris,
that in Berwick (whair commonlie befoir thair used to
be slauchter, be ressone of quarrellis that used to aryse amongis
soldartis) thair was as great quyetnes, all the tyme that I remaned
thair, as thair is this day in Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> And whare
the sclander me of magick, nycromancie, or of any other arte
forbidden of God, I have witnesses, (besydis my awin conscience,)
all<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> congregationis that ever heard me, what I spake
both against suche artis, and against those that use suche impietie.
But, seing the wicked of the world said, That my
Maister, the Lord Jesus, was possessed with Beelzebub, I man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
patientlie bear, albeit that I, wretched synnar, be injustlie
accused of those, that never delyted in the veritie."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE QUENIS

OBJECTIOUN.</div>

<p>"But yit, (said sche) ye have taught the peeple to receave
ane other Religioun, than thair Princes can allow: And how
can that doctrin be of God, seing, that God commandis subjectis
to obey thair Princes?"</p>

<div class="sidenote10">[ANSWER]</div>

<p>"Madam, (said he,) as rycht Religioun tooke nather originall
strenth<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> nor authoritie frome worldly Princes, but frome
the Eternall God allone, so are not subjectis bound to frame
thair Religioun according to the appetites of thair Princes.
For oft it is, that Princes ar the most ignorant of all otheris in
Goddis treu Religioun, as we may reid in the historyes alse
weill befoir the death of Christ Jesus, as efter. Yf all the
sead of Abraham should have bene of the Religioun of Pharao,
whome to thei war lang subjectis, I pray you, Madam, what
Religioun should thair have bene in the world? Or, yf all
men in the dayis of the Apostles should have bene of the Religioun
of the Romane Emperouris, what Religioun should
thair have bene upoun the face of the earth? Daniell and
his fellowis war subjectis to Nabuchadonozzar, and unto Darius,
and yitt, Madam, thei wold nott be of thair Religioun, neather
of the one or of the other: for the thre Children said, "We
maik it known unto thee, O King, that we will not worschip thy
goddis." And Daniell did pray publictlie unto his God against
the expressed commandiment of the King. And so, Madam,
ye may perceave, that subjectis ar not bound to the Religioun
of thair Princes, albeit thei ar commanded to geve thame
obedience."</p>

<p>"Yf thair Princes exceed thair boundis, (quod he,) Madam,
and do against that whairfoir they should be obeyed, it is no
doubt but thei may be resisted, evin by power. For thair is
neather greattar honour, nor greattar obedience to be gevin to
kings or princes, then God hes commanded to be gevin unto
father and mother: But so it is, Madam, that the father may
be stricken with a phrensye, in the which he wold slay his
awin childrene. Now, Madame, yf the children aryese, joyne
thame selfis togetther, apprehend the father, tack the sweard
or other weaponis frome him, and finallie bind his handis, and
keape him in preasone, till that his phrenesy be over past; think
ye, Madam, that the children do any wrang? Or, think ye,
Madam, that God wilbe offended with thame that have stayed
thair father to committ wickedness? It is even so, (said he,)
Madam, with Princes that wold murther the children of God
that are subject unto thame. Thair blynd zeall is no thing
but a verray mad phrenesie; and thairfoir, to tack the sweard
frome thame, to bynd thair handis, and to cast thame selfis in
preasone, till that thei be brought to a more sober mynd, is no
disobedience against princes, but just obedience, becaus that it
aggreith with the will of God."</p>

and nott what I command: and so man I be subject to thame,
and nott thei to me."</p>

<p>"God forbid, (answered he,) that ever I tack upoun me to
command any to obey me, or yitt to set subjectis at libertie to
do what pleaseth thame. Bot my travell is, that boyth princes
and subjectis obey God. And think not, (said he,) Madam,
that wrong is done unto you, when ye ar willed to be subject
unto God: for it is he that subjects people under princes, and
causses obedience to be gevin unto thame; yea, God craves
of Kingis That thei be as it war foster-fatheris to his Churche,
and commands Quenis to be nurisses unto his people. And
this subjectioun, Madam, unto God, and unto his trubled
Churche, is the greatest dignitie that flesche can get upoun the

<div class="sidenote">THE QUENIS

<p>"Yea, (quod sche,) but ye are not the Kirk that I will
nureiss. I will defend the Kirk of Rome, for, I think, it is the

<p>"Your will, (quod he,) Madam, is no reassone; neather
doeth your thoght maik that Romane harlot to be the treu and
immaculat spous of Jesus Christ. And wonder nott, Madam,
that I call Rome a harlott; for that Churche is altogidder polluted
with all kynd of spirituall fornicatioun, alsweall in
doctrine as in maneris. Yea, Madam, I offer myselff farther to
prove, that the Churche of the Jewes that crucifyed Christ Jesus,
was not so far degenerated frome the ordinances and statutis
which God gave be Moses and Aharon unto his people, when
that thei manifestlie denyed the Sone of God,<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> as that the
Churche of Rome is declyned, and more than five hundreth

<p>"But, (said sche,) I have bayth heard and red."</p>

<div class="sidenote10">QUESTIOUN.</div>

<p>"So, (said he,) Madam, did the Jewes that crucifyed Christ
Jesus, read both the Law and the Prophetis, and heard the same
interprete after thair maner. Have ye heard, (said he,) any
teache, but such as the Pope and his Cardinalles have allowed?
And ye may be assured, that suche will speak nothing to
offend thair awin estaite."</p>

<div class="sidenote10">ANSWRE.</div>

<p>"Ye interprete the Scripturis (said she,) in one maner, and
thei interprete in ane other; Whome shall I beleve? And who
shalbe judge?"</p>

<div class="sidenote10">MESSE.</div>

<p>"Ye shall beleve (said he,) God, that planelie speaketh in
his word: and farther then the word teaches you, ye neather
shall beleve the ane or the other. The word of God is plane
in the self; and yf thair appear any obscuritie in one place, the
Holy Ghost, whiche is never contrariouse to him self, explanes
the same more clearlie in other places: so that thair can remane
no doubt, but unto suche as obstinatlie remane ignorant.
And now, (said he,) Madam, to tack ane of the cheaf pointis,
whiche this day is in contraversie betwix the Papistis and us:
for example, the Papistis allege, and boldly have affirmed,
That the Messe is the ordinance of God, and the institutioun of
Jesus Christ, and a sacrifice for the synnes of the quyck and
the dead. We deny bothe the one and the other, and affirme,
that the Messe, as it is now used, is nothing but the inventioun
of man; and, thairfoir, is an abominatioun befoir God, and no
sacrifice that ever God commanded. Now, Madam, who shall
judge betwix us two thus contending? It is no reassone that
eather of the parteis be farther beleved, then thei are able to
prove by insuspect witnessing: Let thame lay down the book
of God, and by the plane wordis thairof prove their affirmatives,
and we shall geve unto thame the pley granted. But so
long as thei ar bold to affirme, and yit do prove nothing, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
man say, that albeit all the warld beleved thame, yit beleve
thei not God, but receaves the lyes of men for the treuth of
God. What oure maister Jesus Christ did, we know by his
Evangelistis: what the preast doeth at his Messe, the warld
seeth. Now, doeth nott the word of God planelie assure us,
that Christ Jesus neather said, nor yit commanded Messe to be
said at his Last Suppar, seing that no suche thing as thair
Messe is maid mentioun of within the whole Scripturis?"</p>

<p>"Ye ar oure sair for me, (said the Quene,) but and yf thai
war here that I have heard, thai wold ansuer you."</p>

<p>"Madam, (quod the other,) wold to God that the learnedest
Papist in Europe, and he that ye wold best beleve, war present
with your Grace to sustene the argument; and that ye wald
patientlie abyd to hear the mater reassoned to the end; for
then I doubt not, Madam, but that ye should hear the vanitie
of the Papisticall religioun, and how small<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> ground it hath
within the wourd of God."</p>

<p>"Weall (said sche) ye may perchance gett that sonner than
ye beleve."</p>

<p>"Assuredlie, (said the other) yf ever I gett that in my lyeff,
I gett it sonnar than I beleif; for the ignorant Papistis can
not patientlie reassoun, and the learned and crafty Papist will
never come in your audience, Madam, to have the ground of
thair religioun searched out; for thai know that thai ar never
able to sustene ane argument, except fyre and sweard, and
thair awin lawis be judges."</p>

<p>"So say ye, (quod the Quene,) but I cane beleve that."</p>

<p>"It hes bene so to this day,<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> (quod he,) for how oft have the
Papistis in this and other realmes bein required to come to
conference, and yitt could it never be obteaned, unless that
thame selfis war admitted for judges. And thairfoir, Madam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
I must yitt say agane, that thai dar never dispute, but whare
thame selfis are both judge and partye. And whensoever that
ye shall let me see the contrarye, I shall grant my selff to
have bene deceaved in that poynt."</p>

<p>And with this the Quene was called upon to dennar, for it
was after-noon. At departing, Johnne Knox said unto hir,
"I pray God, Madam, that ye may be als blessed within the
Commoun-wealth of Scotland, yf it be the pleasur of God, as
ever Debora was in the Commoun-wealth of Israell."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Of this long Conference, whairof we onlie tueich a part, war
diverse opinionis. The Papistis grudged, and feared that
which thai neided not. The godlye, thinking at least that
sche wold have heard the preaching, rejoised; but thai war
alluterly deceaved, for sche continewed in her Messing; and dispised
and quyetlie mocked all exhortationis.</p>

<p>The Generall Assemblie of the Churche<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> approched, holdin
in December<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> after the Quenis arryvall; in the which began
the reullaris of the Courte to draw tham selfis apart from the
societie of thair brethren, and began to sturr and grudge that
any thing should be consulted upoun, without thair advises.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Maister Johne Wode,<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> who befoir had schawin him self verray
fervent in the caus of God, and fordward in giveing of his
counsall in all doubtfull materis, planelie refused ever to assist
the Assemblie agane, whairof many did wonder. The Courteouris
drew unto thame some of the Lordis, and wold nott
convene with thair brethren, as befoir thai war accustomed,
but keapt thame in the Abbay. The principall Commissionaris
of the Churches,<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> the Superintendentis, and some Ministeris,
past unto thame, whair thai war convened in the Abbottis
ludging within Halyrudhouse. Boyth the partyis began
to oppin thair greaf. The Lordis complayned that the
Ministeris drew the gentilmen into secreat, and held counsallis
without thair knowledge. The Ministeris denyed that thai
had done any thing in secreat, or otherwyse than the Commoun
Ordour commanded thame; and accused the Lordis (the
flatteraris of the Quene we mean) that thai keapt not the Conventioun
with thair brethren, considdering that thai know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the Ordour, and that the same was appointed by thair awin
advises, as the Buke of Discipline, subscrivit with the most
part of thair awin handis, wold witness. Some began to deny
that ever thai knew such a thing as the Buke of Discipline;
and called also in doubt, whitther it was expedient that such
Conventionis should be or not; for glaidlye wold the Quene
and hir Secreat Counsall have had all assemblies of the godly
discharged.</p>

<p>The reassonyng was scharp and quick on eather part.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> The
Quenis factioun alledged, that it was suspitious to Princes that
subjectis should assemble thame selffis and keape conventionis
without thair knowledge. It was ansuered, That without knowledge
of the Prince, the Churche did nothing. For the Prince
perfytlie understood, that within this Realme thair was a Reformed
Churche, and that thai had thair ordouris and appointed
tymes of conventioun; and so without knowledge of the
Prince thai did nothing. "Yea," said Lethingtoun, "the Quene
knew and knowest it weill yneuch; but the questioun is,
Whetther that the Quene allowis such Conventionis?" It was
ansuered, "Yf the libertie of the Churche should stand<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> upoun
the Quenis allowance or dyssallowance, we are assured not onlie
to lack assemblies, but also to lack the publict preaching of
the Evangell." That affirmative was mocked, and the contrarie
affirmed. "Weill, (said the other,) tyme will try the treuth;
but to my formar wordis, this will I add, tack from us the
fredome of Assemblies, and tack from us the Evangell; for
without Assemblies, how shall good ordour and unitie in doctrine
be keapt? It is not to be supposed, that all Ministeris
shalbe so perfyte, but that thai shall nead admonitioun, alsweill
concernyng maneris as doctrin, as it may be that some be
so styff necked that thai will not admitt the admonitioun of
the simple; as also it may be that falt may be found with Ministeris
without just offence committed: and yit yf ordour be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
not tacken boyth with the compleaner and the personis compleaned
upoun, it can not be avoided, but that many grevouse
offenses shall aryse. For remeady whairof, of necessitie it is,
that Generall Assemblies maun be, in the which the judgement
and the gravitie of many may concur, to correct or to represse
the folyes or errouris of a few." Heirunto consented
the most parte, alsweill of the Nobilitie as of the Baronis, and
willed the reassonaris for the parte of the Quene to will hir
Grace, yf that sche stood in any suspitioun of any thing that
was to be entreated in thair Assemblies, that it wold please
hir Grace to send such as sche wold appoint to hear whatsoever
was proponed or reassoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEDINGTON
APPONED
HYM TO THE
BOOK OF
DISCIPLENE</div>

<p>Heirafter was the Buke of Discipline proponed, and desyred
to have been ratified by the Quenys Majestie. That was scripped
at, and the questioun was demanded, "How many of those
that had subscrived that Buke wald be subject unto it?" It
was answered, "All the godly." "Will the Duck?" said Lethingtoun.
"Yf he will nott," answered the Lord Ochiltrie,<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> "I
wold that he war scrapped out, not only of that book, but also
out of our nomber and cumpany: For to what purpoise shall
laubouris be tane to putt the Kirk in ordour, and to what end
shall men subscrive, and then never mean to keap wourd
of that quhilk thei promeisse?" Lethingtoun answered, "Many
subscrived thair <i>in fide parentum</i>, as the barnes ar baptized."
One, to wit Johne Knox,<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> answered, "Albeit ye think that
scoiif propir, yit as it is most untreu, so is it most improper.
That Buke was red in publict audience, and by the space of
diverse dayis the headis thairof war reasoned, as all that hear
sit know weill yneuche, and ye your self can nott deny; so
that no man was required to subscrive that whiche he understood
not." "Stand content, (said one,) that Buke will nott be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
obteaned." "Let God (said the other) requyre the lack which
this poore Commoun-wealth shall have of the thingis thairin
conteaned, from the handis of such as stope the same."</p>

<p>The Baronis perceaving that the Buke of Discipline was
refused, presented unto the Counsall certane articles, requiring
Idolatrie to be suppressed, thair Churches to be planted with
treu Ministeris, and some certane Provisioun to be maid for
thame, according to equitie and conscience; for unto that
tyme, the most parte of the Ministeris had lyved upoun the
benevolence of men. For many held into thair awin handis<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>
the fructis that the Bischoppis and otheris of that sect had
befoir abused; and so some parte was bestowed upoun the
Ministeris. But then the Bischoppis began to grypp agane to
that which most injustlie thei called thair awin; for the Erle
of Arrane was discharged of Sanctandrois and Dunfermeling,
whairwith befoir, be verteu of a factorie, he had intromitted:
and so war many otheris. And thairfoir the Barones requyred,
that ordour mycht be tacken for thair Ministeris, or ellis
thei wold no moir obey the Bischoppis, neather yitt suffer any
thing to be lifted up to thair use after the Quenis arryvall,
then that thei did befoir; for thei verrelie supposed that the
Quenys Majestie wold keapt promeisse maid unto thame;
whiche was, nott to alter thair religioun, whiche could nott
remane without Ministeris, and Ministeris could nott lyve
without provisioun: and thairfoir thei heartlie<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> desyred the
Counsall to provid some convenient ordour in that head.</p>

<p>That somewhat moved the Quenys flatteraris; for the rode of
impietie was not then strenthened in hyr and thair handis.
And so began thei to practise how thei should pleise the
Queyn, and yit seam somewhat to satisfie the faythfull;
and so devised thei, that the Church men should have intromissioun
with the Two parte of thair benefices, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">JOHNE KNOX
HIS JUDGEMENT
OF THE
THRIDDIS.</div>

<p>The Ministeris, evin in the begynnyng, in publict Sermonis
opponed thame selves to suche corruptioun, for thei foirsaw
the purpose of the Devill, and clearlie understood the butt
whairat the Quene and hir flatteraris schot; and so in the
stoolle of Edinburgh, Johne Knox said, "Weill, yf the end of
this ordour, pretended to be tacken for sustentatioun of the
Ministeris, be happy, my judgement failleth me; for I am assured
that the Spreit of God is nott the auctor of it; for, first,
I see Twa partis freely gevin to the Devill, and the Thrid maun
be devided betwix God and the Devill: Weill, bear witnes to
me, that this day I say it, or it be long the Devill shall have
Three partis of the Thrid; and judge you then, what Goddis portioun
shalbe." This was ane unsaverie saying in the earis of
many. Some eschamed nott to affirme, "The Ministeris being
susteaned, the Quene will nott gett at the yearis end to by
hir a pair of new schoes." And this was Secreatarie Lethingtoun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LET THIS
BE NOTTED</div>

<p>Thair war appointed to modifie the Ministeris stipendis,<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>
the Erles Ergyle, Murray, and Mortoun, Lethingtoun, the
Justice Cleark, and Cleark of Registrie. The Laird of Pittarro
was appointed to pay the Ministeris stipendis, according
to thair modificatioun. Who wold have thought, that when
Joseph reulled Egypt, that his brethren should have travailled
for vittallis, and have returned with empty seekis unto thair
families? Men wold rather have thought that Pharao's pose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
treasure, and garnallis should have bene diminished, or that
the houshold of Jacob should stand in danger to sterve for
hungar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANE PROVERBE.</div>

<p>But so busy and circumspect war the Modificatouris, (becaus
it was a new office, the terme must also be new,) that
the Ministeris should nott be ower wantoun, that ane hundreth
markis was sufficient to a singill man, being a commoun
minister. Thre hundreth markis was the hiest that was appointed
to any, except unto the Superintendentis, and unto a
few otheris. Schortlie, whitther it was the nygartnesse of
thair awin heartis, or the cayre that thei had to enryche the
Quene, we know nott; but the poor Ministeris, Readaris, and
Exhortaris cryed out to the heavin, (as thair complaintis in all
Assemblies do witnesse,) that neathor war thei able to lyve
upoun the stipendis appointed, neather could thei gett payment
of that small thing that was appointed. So fayne wold
the Comptrollare have played the goode vallett,<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> and have
satisfyed the Quene, or ellis his awin proffeitt in everie point,
that he gatt this dicton and proverbe, "The good Laird of
Pittarro<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> was ane earnest professor of Christ; but the mekle
Devill receave the Comptrollar, for he and his Collectouris ar
become gready fectouris."<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></p>

<p>To put ane end to this unpleasing mater: when the Brethren
compleaned of thair povertie, it was disdanfullie ansuered of
some, "Thair ar many Lordis have not so much to spend."
When men did reassone that the vocatioun of Ministeris craved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
of thame bookis, quyetnesse, studye, and travell, to edifye the
Kirk of Jesus Christ, when that many Lairdis war waitting
upoun thair worldly busyness; and thairfoir, that the stipendis
of Ministeris, who had none other industrye, but to lyve
upoun that which was appointed, aught nott to be modifyed
according to the lyvingis of<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> commoun men, who mycht, and
did daily augment thair rentis by some other industrie. When
suche reassonis war laid befoir thame, thei gat none other ansuer,
but "The Quene can spair no greattar soumes." Oft was
it cryed into thair earis, "O happy servandis of the Devill,
and miserable servandis of Jesus Christ; yf that after this
lyef thair war nott hell and heavin." For to the servandis
of the devill, to your dum dogges and horned bischoppis,
to one of those idill bellies (I say) ten thousand was nott
yneuch; but to the servandis of Christ that painefullie
preache his evangell, a thousand pound; how can that be
susteaned?</p>

<p>One day, in reassoning of this mater, the Secretar burst out
in a pece of his cholere, and said, "The Ministeris have this
much payed unto thame by year, and who yitt ever bad the
Queyn 'grand-mercies' for it? Was thair ever a Minister that
gave thankis to God for hir Majesties liberalitie towards
thame?" One smyled and ansuered, "Assuredlye, I think,
that such as receave any thing gratis of the Quene, are unthankfull
yf thei acknowledge it not, boyth in heart and
mouth. But whitther that the Ministeris be of that rank or
not, I greatlie doubt. Gratis, I am assured, thei receave nothing;
and whitther thai receave any thing at all fra the
Quene, wyese men may reassone. I am assured that neather
Thrid nor Twa part ever apperteaned to any of hir predecessouris
within this Realme these thousand yearis bypast,
neather yitt hes the Quene bettir title to that whiche sche
usurpes, be it geving to otheris, or in tacken to hir self, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
suche as crucifyed Christ Jesus had to devide his garmentis
amonges thame. And yf the treuth may be spoken, sche hes
nott so good titill as thai had; for such spoyle use to be the
reward of such men: And in that point these soldiouris war
more gentle than the Quene and hir flatteraris, for thai parted
not the garmentis of our Maister till that he him self was hung
upoun the croce; but sche and her flatteraris do part the
spoyle, whill as poore Christ is yet preaching amangis you. But
the wisdome of our God tackis tryall of us by this meane,
knowing weall yneuch what sche and hir factioun hes purposed
to do. Lett the Papistis, who have the Twa partis, some that
have thair Thriddis free, and some that have gotten Abbacies
and few landis, thank the Quene, and syng, <i>Placebo Dominæ</i>.
The poore preachearis will not yit flatter, for feading of thair
bellye." These wordis war judged proud and intollerable, and
engendered no small displeasur to the speakar.</p>

<p>This we put in memorie, that the posteriteis to cum may
know that God ones maid his treuth to triumph; but becaus
that some of oure selfis delyted more in darknes than in lyght,<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>
God hath restreaned our fredome, and putt the hoill body in
bondage. Yea, the greatest flatteraris have not eschaiped so
free as thai supposed; yea, the latter plagues appear yit to
be worse than the first. "Be mercyfull to us, O Lord, and
entreat us nott according to our deservingis; but look thou to
the equitie of the cause which thou hast put into our handis,
and suffer not iniquitie to oppresse thy treuth, for Thy awin
nameis saik, O Lord."</p>

and then maryed upoun Agnes Keyth, dowghter to the Erle

In the marriage thai boyth gat ane admonitioun to
behave thame selves moderatlie in all thingis; "For, (said the
preachear<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> to him,) unto this day the Kirk of God hath receaved
confort by you, and by your laubouris; in the which, yf
heirafter ye shalbe found fayntar then that ye war befoir, it
wilbe said that your Wyeff hath changed your nature." The
greatness of the bancquett, and the vanitie used thairat, offended
many godly. Thair began the masking, which from year to
year hath continewed since. Maister Randolph, agent for the
Quene of England, was then, and sometyme after, in no small
conceat with our Quene; for his Maistres saik, she drank<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
him [in] a coupe of gold, which he possessed with greattar joy,
for the favour of the gevar, then of the gift and valew thairof;
and yit it was honourable.</p>

<p>The thingis that then war in handilling betwix the two
Quenes, whairof Lethingtoun, Secreatarie Cycill, and Maister
Randolph, war ministeris, war of great weight, as we will after
hear.</p>

<p>This wynter, the Erle Bothwell, the Markques Delabuf, and

<p>The feare of God conceaved of his holy worde, the naturall

we aw to the quyetness of our countrie, and the terrible threatnyngis

The impietie be thame committed is so haynous and so horrible,
that as it is ane fact most vyle and rair to be heard of

declair what the prince aweth unto the subjectis, to witt, that as
he is the Minister of God, bearing his sweard for vengeance to
be tackyn on evill doaris, and for the defence of peceable and
quyett men, so aucht he to draw the same without all parcialitie
so oft as in Goddis name he is requyred thairto: Seing

that in the eyes of your hoill Realme now presentlie assembled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">THE
MASK OF
ORLEANCE.</div>

<p>This Supplicatioun was presented by diverse gentilmen.
The flatteraris of the Courte at the first stormed, and asked,
"Who durst avow it?" To whom the Maister, now Lord
Lyndesay answered, "A thousand gentilmen within Edinburgh."
Otheris were eschamed to appone thame selfis thairto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
in publict; but thei suborned the Quene to geve a gentill
answer unto such tyme as the Conventioun was dissolved. And
so sche did; for sche lacks no craft, boyth to cloik and to manteane
impietie (and hurdome in especiall.) Sche alledged,
"That hir Uncle was a strangear, and he had a young cumpany;
but sche should putt suche ordour unto him, and unto
all otheris, that heareafter thei should have no occasioun to
compleane." And so deluded sche the just petitioun of hir
subjectis; and no wounder, for how shall sche punische in
otheris that vice, which in France is free without punishement,
and which Kingis and Cardinallis use most commonlie,
as the mask and dansing of Orleance can witness, whairin
virgenis and menis wyeffis war maid as commoun to King
Harie and Charles, the Cardinallis, unto thair Courte and
pages, as commoun harlottis of the bordell ar unto thair compainzeonis.
The maner was thus:</p>

<p>At the entrie of King Harie of France, in the towne of
Orleance, the matrones, virgenis, and menis wyiffis, war commanded
to present thame selfis in the Kingis palice at nycht,
to daunse: and thei obeyed; for commounlie the Frenche
natioun is not hard to be entreated to vanitie. After fidling
and flyngyng, and when the Cardinall of Lorane<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> had espyed
his pray, he said to the King, "<i>Sire, la primiere est vostre, et faut</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
<i>que je suis</i><a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> <i>le second</i>." That is to say, "Sire, the first choise
is youris, and I man be the secound." And so the King gat
the preeminence, that he had his first electioun. Bot becaus
Cardinallis ar companeonis to Kingis, the Cardinall of Lorane
had the nixt: And thairafter the torches war putt out, and
everie man commanded to provid for him self the best he
myght. What cry was thair of husbandis for thair wyeffis; of
wyiffis, for thair husbandis; of auncient matronis, for thair

<p>But punishement of that enormitie and fearfull attemptat

otheris lamented, and began to bear the mater verray heavelie.
At lenth the Lord Duck his freindis assembled upoun a nycht
upoun the calsey.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> The Abbott of Kylwyning,<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> (who then was

was the principall man at the begyning. To him repaired
many faythfull; and amangis otheris cam Andro Stewart, Lord
Ochiltree, a man rather borne to maik peace, then to brag
upoun the calsey, and demanded the querrall; and being
informed of the formar enormitie said, "Nay, sick impietie
shall nott be sufferred so long as God shall assist us. The
victorye that God in his mercy hath gevin us, we will by

and then merchant of Edinburgh, desyred to speak with
Johne Knox secreatlie; which the said Johne glaidlie granted,
and spack him upoun a nycht, first in the said James's lodgeing,
and thairafter in his awin study. The summe of all thair
communication and conference was:&mdash;The said Earle lamented
his formare inordinate lyef, and especiallie that he was provocked
by the entysmentis of the Quene Regent to do that
which he sore reapented, alsweall against the Laird of Ormestoun,<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>
whose blood was spilt, albeit not in his defalt: But his
cheaf dolour was, that he had misbehaved him self against
the Erle of Arrane, whose favouris he was most willing to redeame,
yf possible it war that sa he mycht; and desyred the
said Johne to geve him his best counsall, "For (said he) yf I
mycht have my Lord of Arrane's favouris, I wald await upoun
the Court with a page and few servandis, to spair my expensis,
whare now I am compelled to keap, for my awin saifty, a
number of wicked and unprofitable men, to the utter destructioun
of my living that is left."</p>

<p>To the which the said Johne ansuered, "My Lord, wold to
God that in me war counsall or judgement that mycht conforte
and releave you. For albeit that to this hour it hath
nott chaunsed me to speik with your Lordship face to face,
yit have I borne a good mynd to your house; and have bene
sorry at my heart of the trubles that I have heard you to be
involved in. For, my Lord, my<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> grandfather, goodsher, and

of the obligatioun of our Scotishe kyndnes: but this is not
the cheaf. But as God hes maid me his publict messinger of
glaid tydings, so is my will earnest that all men may embrase
it, which perfytlie thei can not, so long as that thair remaneth
in thame rancour, malice, or envy. I am verray sorry that ye
have gevin occasioun unto men to be offended with you; but I
am more sory that ye have offended the Majestie of God, who
by such meanes oft punishes the other sinnes of man. And
thairfoir my counsall is, that ye begyn at God, with whom yf
ye will enter in perfyte reconciliatioun, I doubt not but he
shall bow the heartis of men to forget all offenses. And as
for me, yf ye will continue in godlynes, your Lordship shall
command me als boldlie as any that serves your Lordship."</p>

<p>That new truble so greatlie displeased Johne Knox, that
he almost geve ower farther travalling for amytie. But yit,
upoun the excuse of the said Erle, and upoun the declaratioun
of his mynd, he re-entered in laubouris, and so brought it to
pass, that the Laird of Ormestoun referred his satisfactioun
in all thingis to the judgments of the Erles of Arrane and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Murray, whom to the said Erle Bothwell submitted him self
in that head, and thairupoun delyvered his hand wryt. And
so was convoyed by certane of his friends to the loodgeing of
the Kirk-of-Feild, whair the Erle of Arrane was with his friendis,
and the said Johne Knox with him,<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> to bear witnesse and testificatioun

those honouris that freyndis had appointed, (Maister Gavin
Hammyltoun<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> and the Laird of Rikchartoun,<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> war the cheaf

passed unto him, embrased him, and said, "Yf the hearttis be
uprycht, few ceremonyes may serve and content me."</p>

<p>The said Johne Knox, in audience of thame boyth, and of
thair freindis, said, "Now, my Lordis, God hath brought you
to gitther be the laubouris of semple men, in respect of such
as wold have travailled thairin. I know my laubouris ar alreaddy

patientlie bear the mysreporttis and wrangouse judgementis of
men. And now I leave you in peace, and desyres you that ar
the freindis to study that amitie may increase, all formar
offenses being forgett." The freindis on eather partie embrased
other, and the two Erles departed to ane wyndo, and
talked by thame selfis familiarlie a reasonable space. And
thairafter the Erle Boithwell departed for that nycht: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
upoun the nixt day in the mornyng returned, with some of his
honest freinds, and came to the sermoun with the Erle foirsaid;
whairat many rejoised. But God had ane other work
to wyrk then the eyes of men could espy.</p>

<p>The Thurisday nixt<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> they dyned togetther; and thairafter
the said Erle Boithwell and Maister Gawane Hammyltoun
raid to my Lord Duckis Grace, who then was in Kynneill.
What communicatioun was betwix thame, it is not certanelie
knowne, but by the reporte which the said Erle of Arrane maid
to the Quenys Grace, and unto the Erle of Murray, by his
wryttingis. For upoun Fryday, the ferd day after thair reconciliatioun,
the sermon being ended, the said Erle of Arrane
cam to the house of the said Johne Knox, and brought with
him Maister Richart Strang<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> and Alexander Guthre,<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> to whom
he opened the greaf of his mynd befoir that Johne Knox was
called; for he was occupyed, (as commounlie he useth to be
after his sermonis,) in directing of writtingis. Whiche ended,
the said Erle called the thre togetther, and said, "I am
treasonablie betrayed;" and with these wordis began to weape.
Johne Knox demanded, "My Lord, who hes betrayed yow?"
"Ane Judas, or other (said he); but I know it is but my lyef
that is sought: I regard it not." The other said, "My Lord,
I understand not such dark maner of speaking: yf I shall
geve you any ansuer, ye maun speik moir plane." "Weill,
(said he,) I tack you three to witnesse that I oppen this unto
you, and I will wryt it unto the Quene: Ane act of treassone
is laid to my charge; the Erle Bothwell hes schawin to me
in counsall, that he shall tack the Quene, and put hir in my
handis in the Castell of Dumbertane; and that he shall slay
the Erle of Murray, Lethingtoun, and otheris that now mysgyde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
hir: and so shall I and he reull all. But I know that this is
devised to accuse me of treassone; for I know that he will
inform the Quene of it: But I tack you to witnes, that I
oppen it hear unto you; and I will pas incontinent, and
wryte to the Quenis Majestie, and unto my brother the Erle
of Murray."</p>

<p>Johne Knox demanded, "Did ye consent, my Lord, to any
part of that treassone?" He ansuered, "Nay." "Then, (said
he,) in my judgement, his wordis, albeit thei war spoken, can
never be treassone unto you; for the performance of the fact
dependis upoun your will, whairto ye say ye have disassented;
and so shall that purpose evanise and dye by the self, onless
that ye waiken it; for it is not to be supposed that he will
accuse you of that which he him self [hes] devised, and whairto
ye wold not consent." "O, (said he,) ye understand not
what craft is used against me: It is treassone to conceall
treassone." "My Lord, (said he,) treasson maun importe consent
and determinatioun, quhilk<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> I hear upoun neather of

more suyre and moir honorable to you to depend upoun
your [awin] innocencye, and to abyde the injust accusatioun
of ane other, (yf any follow thairof, as I think thair shall not,)
then ye to accuise, (especiallie after so lait reconciliatioun,)
and have none other witnesses but your awin affirmatioun."
"I know, (said he,) that he will offer the combatt unto me;
but that wold not be suffered in France; but I will do that
which I have purposed." And so he departed, and took with
him to his loodgeing the saidis Alexander Guthery and Mr.
Richart Strang; from whense was dyted and written a letter
to the Quenis Majestie, according to the formar purpose, which
letter was direct with all diligence to the Quenis Majestie, who
then was in Falkland.</p>

<p>The Erle him self raid after to Kynneill, to his father, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>

bruyte; but from thense he wrait ane other letter with
his awin hand, in sypher, to the Erle of Murray, compleanyng
upoun his rigorous handelling and entreatment by his awin
father, and by his freindis; and affirmed farther, that he feared
his lyef, in case that he gat not suddane reskew. But thairupoun
he remaned not, but brack the chalmer whairin he was

he was convoyed to the Hallyardis,<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> whair he was keapt till

had caused apprehend Maister Gawan Hammyltoun and the

<p>But yit the letteris of Johne Knox maid all thingis to be
used more circumspectlie; for he<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> did planelie foirwarne the
Erle of Murray, that he espyed the Erle of Arrane to be
stricken with phrenesy, and thairfoir willed not oure great
credytt to be gevin unto his wordis and inventionis. And as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
he advertised, so it cam to pass; for within few dayis his
seaknes increased; he devised of wonderouse signes that he
saw in the heavin; he alledged that he was bewitched; he
wold have bene in the Quenis bed, and affirmed that he was
hir husband; and fynallie, he behaved him self in all thingis
so foolishelie, that his phrenesy could not be hyd. And yit
war the saidis Erle Bothwell and Abbott<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> of Kylwynning

Counsall, with the said Earl of Arrane, who ever stoode ferme,
that the Erle Boithwell proponed to him suche thingis as he
advertissed the Quenis Grace of; but styflie denyed that his
Father, the said Abbote, or freindis, knew any thing thairof,
eathir yit that thei intended any violence against him; but
alledged, that he was enchanted so to think and wryte.
Whairat the Quene, heghlie offended, committed him to preasone,
with the other two, first in the Castell of Sanctandrois,
and thairafter caused thame to be convoyed to the Castell of
Edinburgh. James Stewarte of Cardonall,<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> called Capitane
James, was evill bruited [of], for the rigorous entreatment
that he schew to the said Erle in his seaknes, being appointed
keeper unto him.</p>

<p>To consult upoun these accusationis, the hoill Counsalle was

headis, maid the Quene hir self a long harangue or orisoun;<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>
whairto the said Johne ansuered as followis:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Madame, this is often tymes the just recompense which
God geveth to the stubburne of the world, that becaus thei
will nott hear God speaking to the conforte of the penitent,
and for amendment of the wicked, thai are oft compelled
to hear the fals report of otheris to thair greatter displeasur.
I doubt not but that it cam to the earis of proud Herode,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
that our Maister Christ Jesus called him a fox; but thai
told him not how odiouse a thing it was befoir God to
murther ane innocent, as he had laitlie done befoir, causing
to behead Johne the Baptiste, to reward the dansing of a
harlottis doughtter. Madam, yf the reportaris of my wordis
had bene honest men, thai wold have reaported my wordis,
and the circumstances of the same. But becaus thai wold
have credyte in Courte, and lacking vertew worthy thairof,
thai mon haif somewhat to pleise your Majestie, yf it war
but flatterye and lyes. But such pleasour (yf any your
Grace tack in suche personis) will turn to your everlasting
displeasour. For, Madam, yf your awin earis had heard the
hoill mater that I entreated; yf thair be into you any sparckle
of the Spreit of God, yea, of honestie or wisdome, ye could
not justlie have bene offended with any thing that I spack.
And becaus that ye have heard thair report, please your Grace
to hear my self reherse the same, so neyr as memory will
serve." (It was evin upoun the nixt day after that the sermon
was maid.) "My text, (said he,) Madam, was this, 'And
now, O kings, understand; be learned, ye judges of the earth.'
After, Madam, (said he,) that I had declaired the dignitie of
kingis and reullaris, the honour whairinto God lies placed
thame, the obedience that is dew unto thame, being Goddis
lievtennentis, I demanded this questioun,&mdash;But, O allace! what
compte shall the most part of princes maik befoir that Supreme
Judge, whose throne and authoritie so manifestlie and
schamefullie thai abuse? That the complaynt of Salomon is
this day most trew, to wit, 'That violence and oppressioun
do occupy the throne of God here in this earth:' for whill
that murtheraris, blood-thrystie men, oppressouris, and malefactouris
dar be bold to present thame selfis befoir kingis
and princes, and the poor sanctis of God are banisshed and
exyled, what shall we say, But that the devill hath tacken
possessioun in the throne of God, which aught to be fearfull to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
all wicked doiris, and a refuge to the innocent oppressed.
And how can it otherwyse be? For princes will not understand;
thai will nott be learned as God commandis thame. But
Goddis law thei dispyse, His statutis and holy ordinances thei
will not understand; for in fidling and flynging thei ar more
exercised then in reading or hearing of Goddis most blessed
word; and fidlaris and flatteraris (which commonlie corrupt
the youth) are more pretious in thair eyes then men of wisdome
and gravitie, who by holsome admonitioun mycht beat
doun into thame some part of that vanitie and pryde whairintill
all are borne, but in princes tack [deepe] roote and
strenth by wicked educatioun. And of dansing, Madam, I
said, that albeit in Scripturis I fand no praise of it, and in
prophane wryttaris, that it is termed the jesture rather of those
that ar mad and in phrenesye then of sober men; yitt do I
not utterlie dampne it, provyding that two vices be avoided:
the formare, That the principall vocatioun of those that use
that exercise be not neglected for the pleasur of dansing;
Secoundly, That they daunse not, as the Philisteanis thair
fatheris, for the pleasur that thai tack in the displeasur of
Goddis people. For yf any of boyth thai do, as thai shall receave
the reward of dansaris, and that willbe drynk in hell,
onless thai spedilie repent, so shall God turn thair myrth in
suddane sorow: for God will not alwayes afflict his people,
neither yitt will he alwayes wynk at the tyranny of tyrantis.
Yf any man, Madam, (said he,) will say that I spack more,
let him presentlie accuse me; for I think I have nott only
tueiched the somme, but the verry wordis as I spack them."
Many that stood by bair witnesse with him, that he had
recyted the verray wordis that publictlie he spack.</p>

<p>The Queyn looked about to some of the reaportaris, and said,
"Your wourdis ar scharpe yneuch as ye have spocken thame;
but yitt thei war tald to me in ane uther maner. I know
(said sche) that my Uncles and ye ar nott of ane religioun, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
thairfoir I can nott blame you albeit you have no good opinioun
of thame. But yf ye hear any thing of my self that myslyikis
you, come to my self and tell me, and I shall hear you."</p>

<p>"Madam," quod he, "I am assured that your Uncles ar
enemyes to God, and unto his Sone Jesus Christ; and that for
manteanance of thair awin pompe and worldlie glorie, that
thei spair not to spill the bloode of many innocents; and thairfoir
I am assured that thair interpryses shall have no better
successe then otheris haif had that befoir thame have done
that thei do now. But as to your awin personage, Madam,
I wold be glade to do all that I could to your Graces contentment,
provided that I exceed nott the boundis of my vocatioun.
I am called, Madam, to ane publict functioun within the
Kirk of God, and am appointed by God to rebuk the synnes
and vices of all. I am not appointed to come to everie man in
particular to schaw him his offense; for that laubour war infinite.
Yf your Grace please to frequent the publict sermonis,
then doubt I nott but that ye shall fullie understand boyth
what I like and myslike, als weall in your Majestie as in all
otheris. Or yf your Grace will assigne unto me a certane day
and hour when it will please you to hear the forme and substance
of doctrin whiche is proponed in publict to the Churches
of this Realme, I will most gladlie await upoun your Grace's
pleasur, tyme, and place. But to waitt<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> upoun your chalmer-doore,
or ellis whair, and then to have no farther libertie but to
whisper my mynd in your Grace's eare, or to tell to you what
otheris think and speak of you, neather will my conscience nor
the vocatioun whairto God hath called me suffer it. For albeit
at your Grace's commandiment I am heare now, yitt can not I
tell what other men shall judge of me, that at this tyme of day
am absent from my book and wayting upoun the Courte."</p>

<p>"You will not alwayis," said sche, "be at your book," and
so turned hir back. And the said Johne Knox departed with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
reasonable meary countenance; whairat some Papistis offended
said, "He is not effrayed." Which heard of him, he answered,
"Why should the pleasing face of a gentill woman effray me?
I have looked in the faces of many angrie men, and yit have
nott bene effrayed above measure." And so left he the Quene
and the Courte for that tyme.</p>

<p>In this meanetyme, the negotiatioun and credytte<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> was great

headis entreated concernying good ordour to be keapt in the
Churche; for the Papistis and the idolatrie of the Queyn began
to truble the formar good ordouris. Some ministeris, suche
as Maister Johne Scharpe,<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> had left thair charges, and entered
into other vocationis more profitable for the belly; against
whom war actis maid, althought to this day thei have nott
bene putt in executioun.</p>

<p>The tennour of the Supplicatioun redd in oppen audience,
and approved by the hoill Assemblye to be presented to the
Quenis Majestie, was this:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

repent, we can not but signify unto your Hienes, and unto
your Counsall, that the estait of this Realme is sic for this
present, that onless redress and remeady be schortlie provided,
that Goddis hand can not long spayr in his anger, to stryck
the head and the taill; the inobedient Prince and synfull
people: For as God is unchangeable and trew, so must he

TO
HAVE MANY
FAVOURARIS.</div>

<p>And that your Grace and Counsall may understand what be
the thingis we desyre to be reformed, we will begyn at that
quhilk we assuredlie know to be the fontane and spring of all
other evillis that now abound in this Realme, to wit, That idoll
and bastard service of God, the Messe; the fontane, we call it,
of all impietie, not only becaus that many tack boldnes to syn
be reassone of the opinioun which thei have conceaved of that
idoll, to wit, That by the vertew of it, thei get remissioun of
thair synnes; but also becaus that under the cullour of the
Messe, are hoores, adulteraris, drunkardis, blasphemaris of God,
of His holy Word and Sacramentis, and such other manifest
malcfactouris, manteaned and defended: for lett any Messesayare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
or earnest manteanar thairof be deprehended in any of
the foirnamed crymes, no executioun can be had, for all is
done in haiterent of his religioun; and so are wicked men permitted
to live wickedlie, clocked and defended by that odious
idoll. But supposing that the Messe war occasioun of no such
evillis, yit in the self it is so odiouse in Goddis presence, that
we can not cease with all instance to desyre the removing of
the same, alsweall frome your self as from all otheris within
this Realme, tacking heavin and earth, yea, and your awin conscience
to record, that the obstinat manteanance of that idoll
shall in the end be to you destructioun of saule and body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>Yf your Majestie demand, why that now we ar more earnest
then we have bein heirtofoir; We ansuer, (our formar silence no
wiese excused,) becaus we fynd us frustrat of our hope and expectatioun;
quhilk was, that in processe of tyme, your Grace's
heart should have bein mollifyed, so far as that ye wold have
heard the publict doctrin taught within this Realme; by the
quhilk, our farther hope was, that Goddis Holy Spreit should
so have moved your hearte, that ye should have suffered your
religioun (quhilk befoir God is nothing but abominatioun and
vanitie) to have been tryed by the trew tueich-stone, the
writtin word of God; and that your Grace fynding it to have
no ground nor fundatioun in the same, should have gevin that
glorie unto God, that ye wold have preferred his treuth unto
your awin preconceaved vane opinioun, of what antiquitie that
ever it hes bene. Whairof we in a parte now discoraged<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>
cane no longer keape silence, onless we wold mack our selfis
criminall befoir God of your blood, perisheing in your awin
iniquitie; for we plainlie admonishe you of the dangearis to
come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GRUDGEING
OF THE
NOBILITIE
ONE
AGAINST
OTHER</div>

<p>The Secound that we requyre, is punishement of horrible
vices, sic as ar adultery, fornicatioun, open hurdome, blasphemye,
contempt of God, of his Word, and Sacramentis; quhilkis in
this Realme, for lack of punishement, do evin now so abound,
that syne is reputed to be no syne. And thairfoir, as that we
see the present signes of Goddis wrath now manifestlie appear,
so do we foirwarne, that he will stryck, or it be long, yf his law
without punishement be permitted thus manifestlie to be contempned.
Yf any object, that punishementis can nott be commanded
to be executed without a Parliament; We answer that
the eternall God in his Parliament has pronounced death to
be the punishement for adulterye and for blasphemye; whose
actis yf ye putt not to executioun, (seing that Kingis ar but
his lieutennentis, having no power to geve lyefe, whair he commandis
death,) as that he will reputt you, and all otheris that
foster vice, patronis of impietie, so will he nott faill to punishe
you for neglecting of his judgementis.</p>

<p>Our Third requeast concerneth the Poore, who be of thre
sortis: the poore lauboraris of the ground; the poore desolat
beggaris, orphelyns, wedoes, and strangaris; and the poore
ministeris of Christ Jesus his holie evangell, quhilk ar all so
crewallie entreated by this last pretended Ordour tacken for
sustentatioun of Ministeris, that thair latter miserie far surmonteth
the formar. For now the poore lauboraris of the
ground ar so oppressed by the creualtie of those that pay thair
Thrid, that they for the most parte advance upoun the poore,
whatsoever they pay to the Quene, or to any other. As for
the verray indigent and poore, to whome God commandis a
sustentatioun to be provided of the Teyndis, they ar so dyspised,
that it is a wonder that the sone geveth heat and lycht to the
earth, whair Godis name is so frequentlie called upoun, and
no mercy (according to his commandiment) schawin to his
creaturis. And also for the Ministeris, thair lyvingis ar so
appointed, that the most parte shall lyve but a beggaris lyef.
And all cumeth of that impietie, that the idill bellies of Christis
ennemyes mon be fedd in thair formare delicacie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>We dar nott conceall frome your Grace and Honouris our
conscience, quhilk is this, That neather by the law of God,
neather yitt by any just law of man, is any thing dew unto
thame, who now most creuellie do exact of the poore and riche
the Two partes of thair Benefices, as they call thame: And
thairfoir we most humblie requyre, that some other Ordour may
be tacken with thame, nor that thei be sett up agane to impyre
above the people of God, eathir yitt above any subject within
this Realme. For we fear that sic usurpatioun to thair formar
estaite be neather in the end pleasing to thame selfis, nor
profitable to thame that wold place thame in that tyrannye.
Yf any think that a competent lyving is to be assigned to
thame, we repugne not, provided that the Lauboraris of the
ground be nott oppressed, the Poore be nott utterlie neglected,
and the Ministeris of the word so scharplie entreated as now
thay ar. And, finallie, that those idill bellies, who by law can
crave nothing, shall confesse that thei receave thair sustentatioun,
nott of debt, but as of benevolence. Our humble requeast
is thairfoir, that some suddane ordour may be tacken, that the
poore Lauboraris may fynd some releaf, and that in everie
parochine some portioun of the Teyndis may be assigned to the
sustentatioun of the Poore within the same; and lykwise that
some publict releaf may be provided for the Poore within
Broughtis; that collectouris may be appointed to gatther, and
that scharpe comptis may be tacken, alsweall of thair receat as
of thair deliverance. The farther consideratioun to be had to
our Ministeris, we in some parte remitt to your Wisdomes,
and unto thair particular complayntis.</p>

<p>Oure Fourt petitioun is for the mansses, yardis, and gleibes,
justlie apperteanyng to the Ministeris, without the quhilkis it
is unpossible unto thame quyetly to serve thair chargeis; and
thairfoir we desyre ordour to be tacken thairinto without
delay.</p>

<p>Oure Fyft concerneth the inobedience of certane wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
personis, who not onlie truble, and have trubled Ministeris in
thair functioun, but also disobey the Superintendentis in thair
visitatioun; whairof we humblye crave remeady; which we do
not so much for any fear that we and our Ministeris have of
the Papistis, but for the love that we bear to the commoun
tranquillitie. For this we can not hyd from your Majestie
and Counsall, that yf the Papistis think to triumphe whair
thai may, and to do what thai list, whair thair is not a partie
able to resist thame, that some will think, that the godlie mon
begyn whair thai left, who heirtofoir have borne all thingis
patientlie, in hope that Lawes should have brydilled the wicked;
whairof yf thai be frustrat, (albeit that nothing be more
odiouse to thame then tumultis and domesticall discord,) yit
will men attempt the uttermost, befoir that in thair awin eyes
thai behold that House of God demolisshed, quhilk with travaill
and danger God hath within this Realme erected by thame.</p>

<p>Last, We desyre that sick as have receaved remissioun of
thair Thriddis be compelled to susteane the Ministerie within
thair boundis, or ellis we foirwarne your Grace and Counsall,
that we fear that the people shall reteane the hoill in thair
handis, unto sic tyme as thair ministery be sufficientlie provided.
We farther desyre the kirkis to be repared according
to ane Act set furth by the Lordis of Secreat Counsall, befoir
your Majesties arryvall in this countrey: That Judges be appointed
to hear the causes of divorsement; for the Kirk can no
longare sustean that burthen, especiallye becaus thair is no
punishement for the offendars: That sayeris and heararis of
Messe, prophanaris of the Sacramentis, such as have entered
in [to] benefices by the Papis bulles, and such otheris transgressouris
of the Law maid at your Grace's arryvall within this
Realme, may be seveirlie punished; for ellis men will think
that thair is no treuth ment in macking of sick Lawis.</p>

<p>Farther, We most humblye desyre of your Grace and Honorable
Counsall, a resolut ansuer to everie ane of the headis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
foirwritten, that the same being knawin, we may somewhat
satisfie such as be grevouslie offended at manifest iniquitie
now manteaned, at oppressioun under pretext of Law done
against the poor, and at the rebelliouse disobedience of many
wicked personis against Godis word and holy ordinance.</p>

<p>God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, so reull your
heartis, and direct your Grace and Counsallis judgementis by
the dyttament and illuminatioun of his Holy Spreit, that ye
may ansuer so as that your consciences may be absolved in the
presence of that rychteous Judge, the Lord Jesus; and then
we doubt nott but ye your selfis shall fynd felicitie, and this
poor Realme, that long hes bene oppressed by wicked men,
shall enjoy tranquillitie and rest, with the treu knowledge
of God.</p>

wolves and whelpis hes devoured thair lambis, the compleanar
may stand in danger; but the offendar, we feare, shall have
libertie to hunt after his prey." "Sic comparisonis," said
Lethingtoun, "are verray unsaverie; for I am assured, that
the Quene will neather erect, nor yit manteane Papistrie."
"Let your assurance," said ane other, "serve your self, but it
can not assure us, for hir manifest proceadings speakis the
contrair."</p>

<p>After sick tanting reassonyng of boyth the sydis, the multitude
concluded, that the Supplicatioun, as it was conceaved,
should be presented, onless that the Secreatarie wold forme
one more aggreable to the present necessitie. He promest to
keap the substance of ouris, but he wold use other termes, and
ask thingis in a mair gentill maner. The first writtar ansured,
"That he served the Kirk at thair commandiment, and was content,
that in his dictament should men use the libertie that
best pleased thame, provided that he was not compelled to
subscryve to the flatterie of such as more regarded the personis
of men and wemen, then the simple treuth of God."
And so was this formar Supplicatioun gevin to be reformed as
Lethingtounis wisdome thought best. And in verray deid he
framed it so, that when it was delivered by the Superintendentis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
of Lotheane and Fyfe, and when that sche had redd
somewhat of it, sche said, "Here ar many fair wordis: I can
not tell what the heartis ar." And so for our paynted oratorye,
we war termed the nixt name to flatteraris and dissemblaris.
But for that Sessioun the Kirk receaved none other ansuer.</p>

<p>Schort after<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> the conventioun of the Kirk, chansed that unhappy

upoun the Lord Ogilby,<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> who was evill hurt, and almost yit
abydis mutilat. The occasioun was, for certane landis and
rights, quhilkis old Fyndlater had resigned to the said Lord,
which he was perseuing, and was in appearance to obteane his
purpose. Whairat the said Johne and his servandis war
offended, and thairfoir maid the said persuyt, upoun a Setterday,
at nycht, betwix nyne and ten. The freindis of the said
Lord war eather not with him, or ellis not weall willing to
feght that nycht; for thei took straikis, but geve few that left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
markis. The said Johne was tane, and put in the Tolbuyth,
whair he remanent certane dayis, and then brack his warde,
some judged, at his fatheris commandiment; for he was macking
preparatioun for the Quenis cuming to the North, as we
will after hear.</p>

<p>The interview and meating of the two Quenis, delayed till
the nixt year, oure Soverane took purpose to visyt the North,
and departed from Striveling in the moneth of August.
Whitther thair was any secreat pactioun and confederacye
betwix the Papistis in the South, and the Erle of Huntley and
his Papistis in the North; or, to speak more planelie, betwix
the Quene hir self and Huntley, we can not certanlie say.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>
But the suspitionis war wounderous vehement, that thair was
no good will borne to the Erle of Murray, nor yit to such as
depended upoun him at that tyme. The History we shall
faythfullie declair, and so leave the judgement free to the
readaris.</p>

<p>That Johne Gordoun brack his ward, we have already heard,
who immediately thairafter reapared to his father George, then
Eric of Huntley;<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> and understanding the Quenis cuming, maid
graite provisioun in Strabogye, and in other partis, as it war
to receave the Quene. At Aberdene the Quene and Court
remaned certane dayis to deliberat upoun the affaires of the
countrey; whair some began to smell, that the Erle of Huntley
was under gatthering, as heirefter shalbe declaired.</p>

<p>Whill thingis war so wyrking in the North, the Erle Bothwell
brack his ward, and cam furth of the Castell of Edinburgh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
the 28th of August. Some say that he brack the stancheour of
the wyndo; utheris whispered, that he gat easye passage by
the yettis. One thing is certane, to wit, The Quene was litill
offended at his eschaiping. Thair passed with him a servand
of the Capitane's, named James Porterfield. The said Erle
schew him self not verray affrayed, for his commoun residence
was in Lowthean. The Bischope of Sanctandrois and Abbot
of Crosraguell keapt secreat conventioun that same tyme in
Paslay, to whom resorted diverse Papistis; yea, the said
Bischope spack the Duck, unto whom also cam the Lord Gordon
from the Erle of Huntley, requyring him "to putt to his
handis in the South, as he should do in the North; and so it
should not be Knoxis crying nor preaching that should
stay that purpose." The Bischope, be he never so close, could
not altogether hyd his mynd, but at his awin table said, "The
Quene is gone into the North, belyke to seak disobedience:
sche may perchance fynd the thing that sche seikis." It was
constantlie affirmed, that the Erle Bothwell and the said Lord
Gordon spack together, but of thair purpoise we heard no
mentioun.</p>

<p>That same year, and at that instant tyme, war appointed
Commissionaris by the Generall Assemblie to Carryk and

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p><p>These thingis done at Ayr, the said Johne passed to Nethisdaill

Maxwell,<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> a man of great judgment and experience, he communicat
with him such thingis as he feared; who by his motioun
wraytt to the Erle Bothwell, to behave himself as it became
a faythfull subject, and to keape good quyetness in the
partis committed to his charge, and so wold his cryme of the
breaking of the ward be the more easelie pardoned. Johne
Knox wrait unto the Dukis Grace, and earnestlie exhorted
him neather to geve eare to the Bischope<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> his bastard brother,
nor yit to the persuasionis of the Erle of Huntley; for yf he
did, he assured him, that he and his House should come to a
suddane ruyn.</p>

<p>By such meanis war the South partis keapte in reassonable
quyetness, during the tyme that the trubles war in brewing in
the North. And yit the Bischope and the Abbote of Corsraguell,<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a>
did what in thame lay to have rased some truble; for
besydis the fearfull bruytes that thei sparsed abroad, (sometymes
that the Quene was tacken; sometymes that the Erle of
Murray and all his band war slane; and sometymes that the
Quene had gevin her self unto the Erle of Huntley,&mdash;besydis
such bruites) the Bischope, to brek the countrey of Kyle, whair
quyetness was greatest, rased the Craufurdis against the
Readis for the payment of the Bischopis Pasche fynes; but
that was stayed by the laubouris of indifferent men, who
favored peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISPUTATIOUN.</div>

<div class="sidenote">CROSRAGUELL
OFFFRED
HIM ANES
TO PREACH.</div>

<p>The Abbot of Crosraguell requyred disputatioun of Johne
Knox for mantenance of the Messe, which was granted unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
him, and whiche held in Mayboll thre dayis. The Abbot had
the advantage that he requyred, to wit, He took upoun him to
prove that Melchisedeck offered bread and wyne unto God,
which was the ground that the Messe was builded upoun to be
a Sacrifice, &amp;c. But in the travaill of thre dayis thair could no
prooff be produced for Melchisedeckis oblatioun, as in the same
disputatioun (which is to be had in print<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a>) clearlie may appear.
The Papistis constantlie looked for a wolter, and thairfoir
thei wold maid some bragg of reassonyng. The Abbote
farther presented him self to the pulpit, but the voice of
Maister George Hay<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> so effrayed him, that efter ones he
wearyed of that exercise.</p>

<p>After that the Quene was somewhat satisfyed of hunting,
and other pastyme,<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> sche cam to Abirdene, whair the Erle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
Huntley met hir and his Lady, with no small tryne, remaned
in Court, was supposed to have the greatest credyte, departed
with the Quene to Buchquhane, met hir again at Rothymay,
looking that sche should have passed with him to Strabogye.
But in the jorney certane word cam to hir that Johne Gordoun
had brocken promesse in not re-entering in ward; for his
father the Erie had promessed that he should enter agane
within the Castell of Stryveling, and thair abyd the Quenis
pleasur. But whetther with his fatheris knowledge and consent,
or without the same we know not, but he refused to
enter; which so offended the Quene, that she wold not go to
Strabogye, but passed through Straythyla to Innerness, whair
the Castell thairof was denyed unto hir. The Capitane was
commanded to keape it, and looked for releaf, for so had
Johne of Gordoun promessed; but being thairof frustrat, the
Castell was randered, and the Capitane named Gordoun was
executed; the rest war damned, and the handis of some bound,
but eschaiped.</p>

<p>This was the begynning of farther truble; for the Erie of
Huntley thairat offended, began to assemble his folkis, and
spaired not to speak that he wold be revenged. But alwayes
his Wyef bayre faire countenance to the Quene; and it is
verrely supposed, that no other harme then the Quene hir self
could easilie have stand content with, was ment unto hir
awin persone. But the hoill malice lay upoun the Erie of
Murray, Secreatarie Lethingtoun, and upoun the Lard of Pittarro.
Yitt the Quene begane to be effrayed, and by proclamatioun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
caused warne Stryveling, Fyffe, Anguss, Mearness,
and Straytherne, charge all substantiall men to be in Abirdene
the fyfth day of October, thair to remane the space of
twenty dayis. In hir returning from Innerness, sche required
the Castell of Fynlater, which was lykewise denyed, and so
was Auchendowne, which more inflammed the Quein. The
Erie of Huntley was charged to caus deliver the said housses,
under pane of treasson. To schaw some obedience, he caused
the keyis of boyth to be presented by his servand, Mr. Thomas
Keyr. But befoir had the Quene send young Capitane
Stewarte, (sone to Capitane James,<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> who to this day hes neather
bein stout, happye, nor trew,) with sex scoir of soldartis, to ly
about the said place of Fynlater. They lodged in Culane, nott
far distant from the said place. Upoun a nycht Johne Gordoun
cam with a cumpany of horsemen, took the Capitane, slew certane
of the soldiouris, and disarmed the rest. This fact, done (as
the Quene alledged) under traist, so inflambed hir, that all hope
of reconciliatioun was past; and so the said Erle of Huntley
was charged, under pane of putting of him to the home, to present
him self and the said Johne befoir the Quene and Counsall
within sax dayis: whiche charge he disobeyed, and so was
denunced rebell. Whitther it was law or not, we dispute litill
thairintill; but it was a preparative to otheris that after war
served with that same measure. He was sought at his place
of Strathbogye, but eschaped.</p>

<div class="sidenote10">1562.</div>

<p>The evill encreased, for the Erle assembled his folk out of
all partes of the North. He martched forward towardis Abirdene,
and upoun the twenty-twa day of October, the year of
God J<sup>m</sup> V<sup>c</sup> threscoir twa yearis, cam to the Loch of Skein.
His army was judged to sevin or aught hundreth men. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
Quenis army, boyth in nomber and manhead, far surmounted
his, and yitt he took no fear; for he was assured of the most
parte of thame that war with the Quene, as the ishew did
witness. Within the toune thei stood in great fear; and thairfoir
it was concluded that thei wold assaile the uttermost
upoun the feildis. The Forbesses, Hayes, and Leslyes, took
the vantgard, and promessed to feght the said Erle without
any other helpe. Thei passed furth of the toune before ten
houris. Thei putt thame selfis in array, but thei approached

<div class="sidenote">THE ERLE

PRAYER.</div>

<p>The Erle of Huntley was the nycht befoir determined to
have retyred him self and his cumpanye; but that mornyng
he could not be walkened before it was ten houres, and when
he was up on foote his spreitis failed him, (be reassone of his
corpolencie,) so that rychtlie a longe tyme he could do nothing.
Some of his freindis, fearing the danger, left him. When that
he looked upoun boyth the cumpanyes, he said, "This great
cumpany that approcheth neyest to us will do us no harm,
thei ar our freindis. I only fear yonder small cumpayne that
stand upoun the hill-syd, yone ar our enemyes. But we ar
anew for thame, yf God be with us." And when he had thus
spoken, he fell upoun his knees, and maid his prayer in this
forme. "O Lord, I have been a bloode thristye man, and by
my meanes hes mekle innocent bloode bein spilt; but wilt thou
geve me victory this day, and I shall serve thee all the dayis of
my lyef."&mdash;Note and observe, good Readar, he confessed that
be had bein a blood-thristy man, and that he had bein the
cause of the schedding of much innocent bloode: but yitt wold
he have had victorye; and what was that ellis, but to have had
power to have schedd more, and then wold he have satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>

martched fordwarte.</p>

<p>The Secreatarie, in few wordis, maid a vehement orisoun,

<p>Schort after the speaking of these and the lyke wordis, the

They war repulsed by the Maister of Lyndsay, and the cumpanyes
of Fyffe and Anguss. Some of thame that fledd
returned, and followed the Erle of Murray, but gave na straykis
till that Huntleyis cumpanye geve back. In the front thair
war slane about eighteen or twenty-foure men, and in the
fleyeing thair fell ney a hundreth. Thair was tacken a hundreth,
and the rest war spaired. The Erle himself was tacken alyve;
his two sons, Johne foirsaid, and Adam Gordoun, war tacken

this lyiff without any wound, or yitt appearance of any strock,
whairof death might have enseued; and so, becaus it was laitt,

the Erle of Murray laubored at the Quenis hand for the saiftye

within the Castell of Edinburgh, the twenty-aught day of
November, whair he remaned till the aught of Februare, when
he was put to ane assise, accused, and convict of treassone; but

<p>In this meantyme the trubles war hote in France; and the

Howsoever it was, Maister Foullare, servand to the said Erle,
cam with letteris to the Quenis Grace, by the which, licence
was permitted to the Erle of Levenox to cum to Scotland, to

<p>The wynter after the death of the Erle of Huntley, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
Courte remaned for the maist part in Edinburgh. The
Preacheouris war wonderous vehement in reprehensioun of all
maner of vice, which then began to habound; and especiallie
avarice, oppressioun of the poor, excesse, ryotouse chear, banketting,
immoderat dansing, and hurdome, that thairof enseuis.
Whairat the Courteouris began to storme, and began to pyck
querrallis against the Preachearis, alledging that all thair
preaching was turned to raylling. Whairunto one of thame
gave ansuer as followeth: "It cumis to our earis that we ar
called raillaris, whairof albeit we wounder, yitt we ar not eschamed,
seing that the most worthy servandis of God that
befoir us have travalled in this vocatioun, have so bein styled.
But unto you do I say, that that same God, who from the begyning
has punished the contempt of his word, and hes poured
furth his vengeance upoun such proude mockaris, shall not
spair you; yea, he shall not spair you befoir the eyis of this
same wicked generatioun, for the pleasur whairof ye dispyse
all holsome admonitionis. Have ye not sein ane greattar than
any of you sitting whair presentlie ye sitt, pyck his naillis,
and pull down his bonet ower his eyis, when idolatrie, witchecraft,
murther, oppressioun, and such vices war rebuked?
Was not his commoun talk, When thei knaiffis have railled
thair fill, then will thei hald thair peace? Have ye not heard
it affirmed to his awin face, that God should revenge that his
blasphemy, evin in the eyis of such as war witnesses to his
iniquitie? Then was the Erle Huntley accused by you, as the
manteanar of idolatrie, and only hinderar of all good ordour.
Him hes God punished, evin according to the threatnyngis
that his and your earis heard; and by your handis hath God
executed his judgementis. But what amendment in any caise
can be espyed in you? Idolatrie was never in greattar rest:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
vertew and verteouse men war never in more contempt: vice
was never more bold, nor less feared punishement. And yitt
who guydis the Quene and Court? Who but the Protestantis?
O horrible sclanderaris of God, and of his holie evangell. Bettir
it war unto you plainelie to renunce Christ Jesus, then thus to
expone his blessed Evangell to mockage. Yf God punishe not

<div class="sidenote">THE DEFENCE

<p>This vehemence provocked the hatterent, not onlie of the

of the Courte war irreverentlie handilled. What was that,
but to raise the heartis of the people against thame? Thei did

And this was the frute the Preachearis gatthered of thair just
reprehensionis.</p>

<div class="sidenote10">1562.</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE QUENIS
PRACTISE.</div>

<p>The Generall Assemblie of the Churche,<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> holden the twenty-fyve
of December, the year of God 1562, approched, in the
which, great complentis war maid, that churches lacked Ministeris;
that Ministeris lacked thair stipendis; that wicked men
war permitted to be School-maisteris, and so to infect the
youth; amongis whom one Maister Robert Cumyn, school-maister
in Aberbrothok, was compleaned upoun by the Laird
of Dun,<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> and sentence was pronunced against him. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
farther compleaned, that idolatrie was erected in diverse partis
of the Realme; for redress whairof, some thought best, that
new supplicatioun should be presented to the Quenis Grace.
Otheris demanded, what ansuer was receaved of the formar?
The Superintendent of Lowtheane confessed the deliverance of
it, "But," said he, "I receaved no ansuer." It was ansuered
for the parte of the Quene, (for hir suppostis war ever thair,)
"That it was weill knawin to the hoill Realme what trubles
had occurred since the last Assemblie; and thairfoir, that thei
should not wounder albeit that the Quene had not ansuered:
but betwix that and the Parliament which was appointed in
May, thei doubted not but that such ordour should be tacken,
as all men should have occasioun to stand content." This satisfyed,
for that tyme, the hoill assemblie: And this was the
practise of the Quene and of hir Counsall, with fair wordis to
dryve tyme, as befoir we have said.</p>

<p>The Assemblie, nochtwithstanding, proceided fordward in
establessing of such ordouris, as whairby vice myght be punished,
and vertew myght be manteaned. And becaus that
thair was a great sclander rissen upoun Paule Meffen,<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> of
whom mentioun is maid in the Secound Booke of this Historie,
commissioun and charge was gevin unto Johne Knox, minister
of Edinburgh, and unto certane of the eldaris of the Kirk of
Edinburgh, to pass to the toune of Jedburgh, whair the said
sclander was rased, and to be found thair the thrid of Januar
nixt, for the tryall to be tane in the sclander rased, and to
hear the articules and complaynt of the said Paule; and after
the tryall, to report the treuth to the Sessioun of the Churche
of Edinburgh; to whom, with the assistance of the Superintendent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
of Lowthiane, commissioun was gevin to decern thairintill.
The tryall and examinatioun of that cryme was difficill.
The sclander was universall in that toune and countrey.
The servand woman of the said Paule had betwix termes left
his house; sche had borne a child; no father to it could she
fynd; but alledged hir self to have bein oppressed late in ane
evening. The said Paule constantlie affirmed him self innocent,
and wold have gevin his publict purgatioun; but becaus
that his accusatouris had tacken upoun thame to prove thair
accusatioun, that was denyed. Many witnesses war produced,
of whom some deponed so clearlie, that the Commissionaris
suspected that thei had bene suborned, and thairfoir thei requyred
to have inspectioun of the places, whair some said thei
saw, and some said thei heard thame in the verray act of iniquitie.
The syght and consideratioun of the places augmented
greatlie the suspitioun. But one thing was most suspitiouse
of all otheris; for the wyiff of the said Paull, ane auncient
matron, was absent from him the space of aucht or nyne
weakis in Dundye; which tyme (or at least a great part thairof)
thei suspected, and he lay nyghtlie in ane house, without
other cumpany than a child of sevin or eight yearis of aige.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HEIR THE
INIQUITIE
OF PAULL
MEFFEN
WAS CLEARLIE
PROVEN</div>

<p>The Judges, notwithstanding these suspitionis, haveing a
good opinioun of the honestye and godlynes of the man,
travalled what thei could (conscience not hurte) to purge him
of the sclander. But God, who wold not that such vilanye
should be clocked and conceiled within his Churche, otherwyese
had decreed; for he brought the brother of the gyltie
woman to the toune, having no mind of such materis, who being
produced by the accusatouris, as one that was prevey of
the fact, and knew the veritie with all circumstances: This
witness, (we say,) which could not be suspected, being produced,
maid the mater so plane and clear, that all suspitioun
was removed; for he it was that convoyed the woman away;
he it was that caused the child to be baptised, alledging it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
be his awin: he it was that caryed frequent message betwix
thame, and from Paull caryed money and claythis diverse
tymes. How soon that ever the said Paule saw that man produced,
as witnesse, he withdrew himself, and left the toune, by
that mean plainlie tacken upon him the cryme; and so the
Commissionaris with full informatioun returned to Edinburgh,
and notified the fact unto the Churche, who caused publictlie
summond the said Paull to hear the sentence pronunced; who
not compearing, in the end, for his odiouse cryme and contumacye,
was publictlie excommunicated, and depryved of all
functioun within the Churches of Scotland: and so left he the
Realme.</p>

<p>For two causes we insert this horrible fact, and the ordour
keapt in punishment of the same: formar, To foirwarne such
as travaill in that vocatioun, that, according to the admonitioun
of the Apostle, "Suche as stand, tack head lest thei
fall." No man in the begyning of the Evangell was judged
more fervent and more upryght, and yit we have heard how
far Sathane has prevailled against him. God grant that we
may hear of his reapentance.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> Neather yitt aught his fall
any thing to prejudge the authoritie of the doctrin which he
taucht; for the doctrin of God have authoritie of no creature,
but has the assurance of God him self, how weak or imperfite
that ever the instrumentis be by whom it pleases God to
publishe the same. The treason of Judas, the adulterie of
David, and the abnegatioun of Petir, did derogat nothing to
the glorie of Christis evangell, nor yit to the doctrin which
befoir thei had taught; but declaired the one to be a reprobat,
and the other to be instrumentis in whome mercy must neadis
surmount judgement. The other caus is, That the world may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
see what difference thair is betwix light and darknes, betwix
the uprychtness of the Churche of God, and the corruptioun
that ringes in the synagoge of Sathan, the Papisticall rable;
for how many of that sorte hath bein, and still remane openlie

Monsieur Chattelett,<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> a Frencheman, that at that tyme passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
all otheris in credytt with the Quene. In dansing of the
Purpose, (so terme thei that danse, in the which man and
woman talkis<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> secreatlie&mdash;wyese men wold judge such fassionis
more lyke to the bordell than to the comelynes of honest
women,) in this danse the Quene chosed Chattelett, and Chattelett
took the Quene. Chattelett had the best dress. All
this wynter Chattelett was so familiare in the Quenis cabinett,
ayre and laitt, that scarslye could any of the Nobilitie have
access unto hir. The Quene wold ly upoun Chattelettis shoulder,
and sometymes prively she wold steall a kyss of his neck.
And all this was honest yneuch; for it was the gentill entreatment
of a stranger. But the familiaritie was so great, that
upoun a nycht, he privelie did convoy him self under the
Quenis bed; but being espyed, he was commanded away. But
the bruyte arysing, the Quene called the Erle of Murray, and
bursting furth in a womanlie affectioun, charged him, "That as
he loved hir, he should slay Chattelett, and let him never
speak word." The other, at the first, maid promesse so to do;
but after calling to mynd the judgementis of God pronunced
against the scheddaris of innocent bloode, and also that none
should dye, without the testimonye of two or thre witnesses,
returned and fell upoun his kneis befoir the Quene, and said,
"Madam, I beseak your Grace, cause not me tack the blood of
this man upoun me. Your Grace hes entreated him so familiarlie
befoir, that ye have offended all your Nobilitie; and now
yf he shalbe secreatlie slane at your awin commandiment,
what shall the world judge of it? I shall bring him to the
presence of Justice, and let him suffer be law according to his
deserving." "Oh," said the Quene, "ye will never let him
speak?" "I shall do," said he, "Madam, what in me lyeth to
saiff your honour."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p><p>Poor Chattelett was brocht back from Kinghorne to Sanctandrois,
examinat, putt to ane assise, and so beheaded, the
twenty-twa day of Februar, the year of God J<sup>m</sup> V<sup>c</sup> threscoir
twa. He begged licence to wryte to Fraunce the cause of his
death, which, said he, in his toung, was, "Pour estre trouvé en
lieu trop suspect;" that is, "Becaus I was found in a place too
much suspect." At the place of executioun, when he saw that
thair was no remeady but death, he maid a godly confessioun,
and granted, that his declyning from the treuth of God, and
following of vanitie and impietie, was justlie recompensed
upoun him. But in the end he concluded, looking unto the
heavenis, with these words, "O cruelle Dame," that is, "Cruell
Maistress."<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> What that complaint imported, luvaris may devine.
And so receaved Chattelett the reward of his dansing;
for he lacked his head, that his toung should nott utter the
secreattis of our Quene. "Deliver us, O Lord, from the raige
of such inordinat reullaris."</p>

<p>The year of God a thousand fyve hundreth threscoir thre

northland, whair the harvest befoir the Quene had travailled,
thair was ane extreame famyn, in the qubilk many dyed in

was principallie thair. The boll of wheat gave sax pound:
the boll of bear, sax markis and ane half: the boll of meill,

And so all thingis apperteanyng to the sustentatioun of man,

so did God, according to the threatnyng of His law, punish the
idolatrie of our wicked Quene, and our ingratitud, that suffered
hir to defyle the land with that abominatioun agane, that
God so potentlie had purged, by the power of his wourd. For
the ryotouse feasting, and excessive banquetting, used in

provocked God to stryck the staff of braid, and to geve his

<p>The Quene stormed at sick fredome of speaking, but she

used instrumentis in the begynyng. Thei war of one mynd

Particularties had not divided thame; and thairfoir could not

She send for Johne Knox to come unto hir, whair she lay at

<p>" Will ye," quod sche, "allow that thei shall tack my sweard

<p>"The Sweard of Justice," quod he, "Madam, is Goddis, and
is gevin to Princes and reuallaris for ane end, which, yf thei
transgresse, spairing the wicked, and oppressing innocentis,
thei that in the fear of God executis judgement, whair God
hes commanded, offendis not God, althought Kingis do it not;
neather yitt synne thei that brydillis kingis to stryek innocent
men in thair raige. The examples ar evident; for Samuell
feared not to slay Agag, the fat and delicate king of Amalech,
whom king Saule had saved. Neather spaired Helias Jesabellis
fals propheittis, and Baallis preastis, albeit that king
Achab was present. Phyneas was no magistrat, and yit feared

And in this case I wold earnestlie pray your Majestie

<p>Heirwith, she being somewhat offended, passed to hir suppar.
The said Johne Knox left hir, informed the Erle of Murray of
the hoill reassonyng, and so departed of finall purpose to have
returned to Edinburgh, without any farther communicatioun
with the Quene: But befoir the sonne, upoun the morne, war

Whitther it was the nychttis sleape, or a deape dissimulation
lokked in hir breast, that maid hir to forget hir formar anger,
wyese men may doubt; but thairof sche never moved word,

<p>"Yis," said he, "those quarteris have great nead, and some

had not knawin him befoir. And so was the Bischope frustrat
of his purpose for that present. And yit was he, at that
tyme, the man that was most familliare with the said Johne,
in his house, and at table. But now to the formar conference.</p>

<p>When the Queue had long talked with Johne Knox, and he
being oft willing to tack his leave, she said, "I have one of
the greatest materis that have tweiched me since I cam in
this Realme, to open unto you, and I maun have your help

the Lady Ergyle,<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> how that sche was not so circumspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
in all thingis as that sche wisshed hir to be. "And yitt," said
sche, "my Lord, hir husband, whom I love, entreattis hir not
in many thingis so honestlie and so godlie, as I think ye your
self wold requyre."</p>

<p>"Madam," said he, "I have been trubled with that mater
befoir, and anes I put sick ane end to it, (and that was befoir
your Grace's arryvall,) that boith she and hir freindis seamed
fullie to stand content: And she hir self promessed befoir hir
freinds, that sche should never complain to creature, till that
I should first understand the controversie by hir awin mouth,
or ellis [by an] assured messinger. I now have heard nothing
of hir part; and thairfoir I think thair is nothing but concord."</p>

<p>"Weall," said the Quene, "it is war then ye beleve. But do
this mekle for my saik, as anes agane to put thame at unitie;
and if sche behave not hir self so as she aught to do, she shall
find no favouris of me: But, in any wyse, (said sche,) let not
my Lord know that I have requested you in this mater; for I
wald be verray sorry to offend him in that or any other thing.
And now, (said sche,) as tueching our reassonyng yisternycht,
I promess to do as ye requyred; I sall caus summond all
offendaris, and ye shall know that I shall minister Justice."</p>

<p>"I am assured then," said he, "that ye shall please God,
and enjoy rest and tranquillitie within your Realme; which to
your Majestie is more profitable than all the Papes power can
be." And thus thei departed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">"<i>The Lord cumith and shall not tarie, &amp;c.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"After</span> commendatioun of my service unto your Lordschipe,
yf I had knawin of your Lordshipis suddane departing, the
last tyme it chaunsed me to see and speak you, I had opened
unto you somewhat of my greaf. But supposing that your
Lordshipe should have remaned still with the Quenis Grace, I
delayed at that tyme to utter any part of that which now my
conscience compelleth me to do. Your behaviour toward your

grevouse, that ye altogetther withdraw the use of your body

repugnance, than any flesche this day on earth, yitt by promesse,
maid befoir God, ar ye debttour unto hir, as reassonablie
ye shalbe requyred of hir. But yf that ye burne on the one
syd, (albeit ye do no worse,) and sche in your defalt upoun the

what in you lyeth, to kendle against your self his wraith and
havie displeasour. These wordis ar scharpe, and God is witnesse
that in dolour of heart I wraitt thame; but becaus thei
ar trew, and pronunced by God himself, I dar not but admonische
you, perceaving you, as it war, sleaping in synne. The
proude stubburnes, whairof your Lordship hath oft compleaned,
will not excuise you before God; for yf ye be not able to convict
hir of one cryme, ye aught to beir with other imperfectionis,
and that ye wold that she should bear with you, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
lyik. In the bowellis of Christ Jesus, I exhort you, my Lord,
to have respect to your awin salvatioun, and not to abuse the
lenitie and long suffering of God: for that is a fearfull treasure
that ye heap upoun your awin head, whill that he calleth you
to reapentance, and you obstinatlie contineu in your awin impietie;
for impietie it is, that ye abstract your confort and
cumpany from your lauchfull wyff. I wrytt nothing in defence
of hir mysbehavour towardis your Lordship in any sort;
but I say, yf ye be not able to convict hir of adulterie committed
since your last reconciliatioun, which was in my presence,
that ye can never be excuissed befoir God of this
freammed and strange intreatment of your wyff. And yf by
you such impietie be committed, as is bruited, then, befoir
God, and unto your awin conscience I say, that everie moment
of that fylthie pleasure shall turne to you in a yearis displeasur;
yea, it shalbe the occasioun and caus of everlasting
dampnatioun, onless spedelie ye reapent: and reapent ye can
nott, except that ye desist from that impietie. Call to mynd,
my Lord, 'That the servand knawing the will of his Lord,
and doing the contrarie, shalbe plagued with many plagues.'
Syn, my Lord, is sweat in drinkyng, but in digesting more bitter
then the gall. The Eternall move your heart earnestlie to
considder, how fearfull a thing it is ever to have God to be

<p>"In the end, I most heartlie pray your Lordship, not to be
absent from Edinburgh the nynetene of this instant, for sick
causses as I will not wraitt. This much onlie I foirwarne your
Lordship, that it will nott be profitable for the commoun
quyetness of this Realme, that the Papistis brag, and that
justice be mocked that day. And thus I cease farther to

Goddis mercyes which that Realme had felt, and of that ingratitude
quhilk he espyed almost in the hoill multitude, which
God had marvelouslie delivered from the boundage and tyrannye
boyth of body and saule. "And now, my Lordis," said he,
"I praise my God, throught Jesus Christ, that in your awin

ye wold only depend uponn his protectioun, and preferr his

the man that first and most spedelie flyeth from Christis

Parliament was also lauchfull as ever any that passed befoir

but of farther wickednes no mentioun.</p>

<p>Whill the Quene lay at Striveling, with hir idolatrie in hir
chapell, in the Palice of Halyrudhouse war left certane dontybouris,
and otheris of the Frenehe menzie, who raised up thair
Messe more publictlye then they had done at any tyme before.
For upon those same Sundayes that the Church of Edinburgh
had the ministration of the Lordis Table, the Papistis in
great number resorted to the Abbay, to thair abomination.
Which understand, dyverse of the brethren, being sore offended,
consulted how to redress that inormitie; and so war appoynted
certane of the most zelous, and most upryght in the
religion, to await upon the Abbay, that thai myght note such
persones as resorted to the Messe. And perceaving a great
number to enter into the chapell, some of the brethren burst
also in; whereat the Preist and the Frenche dames being
affrayed, made the schout to be sent to the town; and Madame
Raylie,<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> maistres to the Quenis dontiboures, (for maides that
Court could not then beare,) posted on with all diligence to
the Comptrollar, the Laird of Pettarro, who then was in Sanct
Gelis Kirk at the sermon; and cryed for his assistance, to save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
hir lyfe, and to saif the Quenis Palice: Who, with greattar
haist then nead requyred, obeyed hir desyre, and tuik with
him the Provest, the Baillies, and a great part of the faithfull.
But when they came where the feare was bruted to have bene,
they fand all thingis quyet, except the tumult they broght
with thame selves, and peaceable men luiking to the Papistis,
and forbidding thame to transgress the lawis. Trew it is, a
zelous brother, named Patrick Cranstoun, past into the chapell,
and fynding the altar covered, and the Preast reddye to go to
that abomination, said, "The Quenis Majestie is not heir:
how dar thou then be so malepart, as opinlie to do against the
law?" No farther was done nor said, and yit the bruit heirof
was posted to the Quene, (with such information as the Papistis
could give; which fand such credit, as thair heartis could
have wished for,) which was so haynous a cryme in hir eyes,
that satisfactioun for that syn was there none without bloode.
And therfore, without delay was summoned Andro Armstrang<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>
and Patrik Cranstoun, to fynd suyrtie to undirlie the law, for
forethought, fellonie, hamesukkin, violent invation of the
Quenis Palice, and for spoliation of the same.</p>

<p>These letteris divulged,<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> and the extremitie feared, Brethren
(the few that war within the town) consulted upon the next
remedie; and in the end concluded, that Johne Knox (to
whom the charge was geven to mak advertismentis whensoever
daunger sould appear) should wryte to the Brethren in
all quarteris, geving information as the matter stoode, and requyring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>

by our Christian assemblies, and godly conferences, as
oft as any danger appeared to any member or members of

the least not frequented our conventionis and assemblies, the
adversaries of Christ Jesus his holie Evangill have interprysed,
and boldened thame selves publictlie and secretlie, to do many
thingis odious in Goddis presence, and maist hurtfull to the
libertie of trew religion, now of Goddis great favour granted
unto us. The holie Sacramentis are abused be profane Papistis.
Messes have bein (and yit are) opinlie said and manteyned.
The bloode of some of our dearest ministeris has
bein shed, without fear of punishment or correction craved
be us. And now last, are two of our dear brethren, Patrik
Cranstoun and Andro Armstrang, summoned to underly the law,
in the town of Edinburgh, the 24th of this instant October,
'For forethought fellonie, pretended murther, and for invading
the Quenis Majesties Palice of Halyrudhouse, with unlauchfull
convocatioun, &amp;c.' This terrible summonds is direct against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
owre Brethren, because that they with two or thre more, passed
to the Abbey upon Sunday, the 15th of August, to behald and
note what persones repared to the Messe; and that because that
the Sunday before, (the Quenis Grace being absent,) there
resorted to that idole a rascall multitude, having opinlie the
least devillissh ceremonie (yea even the conjuring of thair
accurssed watter) that ever they had in the tyme off greatest
blyndnes. Becaus, (I say,) our said Brethren passed, and that
in maist quyet maner, to note sick abusearis, thir fearfull summondis
ar directed against thame, to mak (no doubt) preparation
upon a few, that a door may be opened to execute
creweltie upon a greattar multitude. And yf so it come to
pass, God, no doubt, has justlie recompanced oure formare
negligence and ingratitude, towardis hym and his benefittis
receaved in oure awin bosoms. God gave to us a most notable
victorie, of his and our ennemies: he brak thair strength,
confounded thair counsailles: he sett us at fredome, and
purged this Realme (for the maist part) of oppin idolatrye;
to the end, that we, ever myndfull of so wounderous a deliverance,
should have keapt this Realme clean from sick vyle
filthiness, and dampnable idolatrie. But we, alace! preferring
the pleasour of flesche [and blude,] to the pleasour and commandement
of our God, have suffered that idoll, the Messe, to
be erected agane, and therfore justlie sufferis he us now to
fall in that danger that to luke to ane idolatour, going to his
idolatrie, salbe repute a cryme lityll inferiour to treasone.
God grant that we fall not farther. And now I, whom God
has of his mercye made one amangis many to travell in setting
fordward of his trew religion within this Realme, seing
the same in danger of ruin, can not but of conscience crave
of you, my Brethren, of all estaitis, that have professed the

nether flatterie nor feare sall mak you sa far to declyne fra

And albeit there ware no great daunger, yet cannot oure

the maner was this: It was read in the town of Ayre, whare
wes present Robert Cunyghame, minister of Faillfurde,<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> who

The said Mr. Hendrie being ennemie to all that
unfeynedlie professed the Lord Jesus, but cheiflie to Johne

still he doth affirme, that a Bischope that receaves proffit, and

<p>"What is this?" said the Quene. "Me think ye tryfill with

then your Grace is, that all convocatiouns ar nocht

quhat authoritie haif ye to convocat my subjectis quhen ye

<p>"I haif no plesour," said Johne Knox, "to declyne from

<p>"Ye sall not eschaip so," said the Quene. "Is it nocht tressoun,
my Lordis, to accuse ane Prince of creweltie? I think
thair be Actis of Parliament aganis sick whisperaris." That
wes grantit of monie.</p>

<p>"But whairintill," said Johne Knox, "can I be accusit?"</p>

<p>"Reid this pairt of your awin bill," said the Quene, quhilk
began, "Thir feirfull summondis is direct aganis thame, (to

"quhat say ye to that?"</p>

<p>Quhill monie doubtit quhan the said Johne sould ansuer, he
said unto the Quene, "Is it lauchfull for me, Madam, to ansuer
for my self? Or sall I be dampned befoir I be hard?"</p>

<p>"Say what ye can," said sche; "for I think ye haif eneuch

<p>"I will first [then] desyre this of your Grace, Madam, and
of this maist Honorabill audience, quhidder gif your Grace
knawis nocht, that the obstinat Papistis ar deidlie ennemeis to

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>The Quene held hir peace: but all the Lordis, with commoun

<p>"I maun proceid than," said Johne Knox, "seing that I

<p>Efter that the Secretar had conferrit with the Quene, he

<p>"I thank God and the Quenis Majestie," said the other.

<p>Ledingtoune and the Maister of Maxwell [were] that nycht

<p>Johne Knox being departit, the Tabill of the Lordis, and
utheris that wer present, wer demandit, everie man be his vote,
Gif Johne Knox had nocht offendit the Quenis Majestie. The

And so the haill Nobylattie absolved Johne Knox agane, and

<p>God from hevin, and upone the face of the eirth, gaif declaratioun
that he wes offendit at the iniquitie that wes committit
evin within this Realme; for upone the 20th day of Januare
thair fell weit in grit aboundance, quhilk in the falling freisit
so vehementlie, that the eirth wes bot ane scheit of ysce.
The foules baith grit and small freisit, and mycht nocht flee:
monie deyit, and sum wer takin and laid besyde the fyre, that
thair fetheris mycht resolve. And in that same moneth the
sey stude still, as wes clerlie observed, and nather ebbit nor
flowit the space of 24. houris. In the moneth of Februare, the
15th and 18th day thairof, wes sene in the fyrmament battelis
arrayit, speiris, and utheris weapounis, and as it had bene the
joinyng of two armeis. Thir thingis wer nocht onlie observed,
bot also spokin and constantlie affyrmed be men of jugement
and credit. But the Quene and our Court maid myrrie.
Thair wes banketting upoun banketting. The Quene wald
banket all the Lordis; and that wes done upoun polessie, to
remove the suspitioune of hir displesour aganis thame, becaus
thai wald nocht at hir devotioun dampne Johne Knox. To
remove, we say, that jeloussie, sche maid the banket to the
haill Lordis, quhairat sche wald haif the Duke amangis the
rest. It behuifit thame to banket hir agane; and so did
banketting continew till Fastronis-evin and efter. But the
pure Mynisteris wer mockit, and reputed as monsteris; the

who affyrmeit, that he had commandiment of hir Heichnes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>

<p>The Mynisteris perceaving all thingis tend to ruyne, dischairgit
thair conscience in publict and in previt; but thay
ressaifit for thair laubouris haitred and indignatioun; and
amangis utheris, that worthie servand of God, Mr. John Craig,
speiking aganis the manifest corruptioun that then withoute
schame or feir declareit the self, said, "Sum tymeis wer hypocriteis
knawin be thair disgyseit habittis, and we had men to

that in opin audience he gaif him unto the Devill, gif that ever

he sould do what he could, that his companyeounis sould haif

And heirupone raise whispering and complainttis, all be the

so lang as Protestantis ar not eschameit manifestlie to do
aganis the evangill of Jesus Chryste, so lang can nocht the
Mynisteris of God ceise to cry, that God wilbe revengit upoun

<p>And thus had the servandis of God ane doubill battell,

And at lenth thai began to jest at the terme of Idolatrie,
affirmyng, "That men wist nocht what thai spak, quhan thai

<p>A lyttill befoir the trubles, quhich Sathan raised in the bodie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>

of the begynning and progress, we delay now forder to speik,
becaus his end will requyre the descryptioune of the whole:

<p>The first day of the Generall Assemblie, the Courtiouris nor
the Lordis that dependit upoun the Court, presentit nocht
thame selfis in the sessioun with thair Bretherin. Whairat
monie wondering, ane anceyant and honorable man, the Laird
of Lundie,<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> said, "Nay, I wonder nocht of thair present absence;

of this offence, quhilk the whole Bretherin haif consaveit
of thair former falt; humblie requyring thame, that gif
thai be Bretherin, thai will assist thair Bretherin with thair
presence and counsall, for we had nevir grytter neid. And gif
thai be myndit to fall back from us, it wer better we knaw it

and gaif commissioun to certene Bretherin to signify the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>

<p>The Courteouris at first semeit nocht a lyttill offendit, that
thay sould be as it wer suspectit of defectioun: yit, nevirtheles,
upoun the morrow, thai joynit with the Assemblie, and come
into it: But thai drew thame selfis, lyke as thai did befoir,
apairt, and enterit the Inner Counsell-house. Thair wes the
Dukis Grace, the Erles Argyle, Murray, Mortoun, Glencarne,
Merchell, Rothes; the Maister of Maxwell, Secretour Lethingtoun,
the Justice Clark, the Clark of Register, and the Controllour,
the Laird of Pittarro.</p>

<p>Efter a lyttill consultatioun, thai direct ane messinger, Mr.
George Hay,<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> than callit the Minister of the Court, requyring
the Superintendantis, and sum of the leirnit ministeris, to
confer with thame. The Assemblie ansuerit, "That thai convenit
to delyberat upoun the commoun effairis of the Kirk;
and, thairfoir, that thay could nocht lack thair Superintendantis
and cheif ministeris, whose jugementis wer so necessarie, that
without thame the rest sould sit as it wer idill; and thairfoir
willand thame (as of befoir) that gif thay acknawlege thame
selfis memberis of the Kirk, that thai wald joyne with the
Bretherin, and propone in publict sik thingis as thai pleissit;
and so thai sould haif the assistance of the whole in all thingis
that mycht stand to Godis commandiment. But to send from
thame selfis a portioun of thair companie, thai understand
that thairof hurt and sclander mycht aryse, rather than anie
proffeit or conforte to the Kirk: for thay feirit, that all men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
sould nocht stand content with the conclusioun, whair the conference
and ressounis wer hard but of a few."</p>

<p>This ansuer wes nocht giffin without cause; for no small
travell wes maid, to haif drawin sum mynisteris to the factioun
of the Courtiouris, and to haif sustenit thair argumentis
and opiniounis. But whan it wes persaifit be the moist politick
amangis thame, that thai could not prevaill be that meanes,
thai proponeit the matter in uther termis, purging thame
selfis, first, that thai nevir ment to devyde<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> thame selfis from
the sociatie of thair bretherin; but, because thai had certane
heidis to confer with certane ministeris; thairfoir, for
avoyding of confusioun, thai thocht it mair expedient to haif
the conference befoir a few, rather than in the publict audience.
But the Assemblie<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> did still reply, "That secreit conference

conclusioun sould be taikin, nether yit voit requyreit, till that
bayth the propositiounis and the ressounis sould be heard, and
considderit of the whole bodie." And upoun that conditioun

And, last, How daingerous ane thing it was, that mynisteris

had in the days of Ezechias? But yit, says the text, 'Manasses
maid Juda and the inhabitantis of Jerusalem to erre.'
True it is; for the one pairt, as I haif said, willinglie followit
him in his idolatrie, and the other, be ressoune of his authoritie,
sufferit him to fyle Jerusalem, and the tempill of God,
with all abhominatiounis, and so wer thai all cryminall for his
sin; the one be act and deid, the uther be suffering and permissioun:
even as hoill Scotland is guiltie this day of the
Quenis idolatrie, and ye, my Lordis, speciallie above all utheris."</p>

<p>"Weill," said Lethingtoun, "that is the cheif heid quhairin
we nevir aggreit; but of that we sall speik heirefter. What
will ye say as tuyching the moveing of the peopill to haif ane
gude opinioun of the Quenis Majestie, and as concerning obedience
to be gevin to hir authoritie, as also of the form of the
prayer quhilk commounlie ye use," &amp;c.</p>

<p>"My Lord," said he, "moir eirnistlie to move the peopill,
or yit utherwyse to pray than heirtofoir I haif done, a gude
conscience will nocht suffer me; for He who knawis the secreittis
of hertis, knawis that privilie and publictlie I haif
callit to God for hir conversioun, and haif willit the peopill to
do the same, schawing thame the dangerous estait quhairin
nocht onelie sche hir self standis, but also the haill Realme, be
the ressoun of hir indureit blindnes," &amp;c.</p>

<p>"That is it," said Lethingtoun, "whairin we find gryttest
falt. Your extremitie aganis hir Messe, in particular, passis
meassour. Ye call hir ane slaif to Sathan; ye affirme that
Godis vengeance hingis oure the Realme, be ressoune of hir

MAXWELL'S
WORDS IN
THE ASSEMBLIE.</div>

<p>Thair wes heard ane exclamatioun of the rest of the flatteraris,
that sick extremittie could nocht proffit. The Maister
of Maxwell said in plane wordis, "Gif I war in the Quenis
Majesties place, I wald nocht suffer sick thingis as I heir."</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOHN KNOX
HIS PRAYER
FOR THE
QUENE.</div>

<p>"Gif the wordis of prechouris," said Johne Knox, "sall alwayis
be rest to the worst pairt, than will it be hard to speik
onie thing so circumspectlie, provyded that the treuth be
spokin, quhilk sall not eschape the censure of the calamniatour.
The moist vehement, and, as ye speak, excessive maneir of
prayer that I use in publict is this, 'O Lord, gif thy plesour
be, purge the hairt of the Quenis Majestie from the venoum of
idolatrie, and deliver hir from the boundage and thraldom of
Sathan, in the quhilk sche hes bene brocht up, and yit remanis,
for the lack of true doctrine; and lat hir see, be the illuminatioun
of thy Holie Spreit, that thair is no meane to pleis
thee but be Jesus Christ thy onlie Son, and that Jesus Christ
can nocht be found but in thy holie word, nor yit ressavit but
as it prescrybeis; which is, to renunce our awin wittis, and preconsavit
opinioun, and worschip thee as thou commandis; that
in sa doing sche may avoid that eternall dampnatioun quhilk
abydeis all obstinat and impenitent unto the end; and that
this poor Realme may also eschaip that plaig and vengeance
quhilk inevitablie followis idolatrie, menteinit aganis thy manifest
worde, and the opin lycht thairof.' This, (said he,) is the
form of my commoun prayer, as your selflis can witnes. Now,
what is worthie reprehensioun in it I wald heir?"</p>

<p>"Thair ar three thingis," said Lethingtoun, "that nevir
lykeit unto me. And the first is, Ye pray for the Quenis Majestie
with ane conditioun, saying, 'Illuminat hir hairt, gif
thy gude plesour be;' quhairby it may appeir, that ye doute of
hir conversioun. Whair haif ye the example of sik prayer?"</p>

<p>"Whairsoevir the exampillis are," said the uther, "I am
assureit of the reule, whilk is this, 'Gif we sall ask onie thing
according to his will, he sall heir us;' and our Maister, Chryst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
Jesus, commandit us to pray unto our Father, 'Thy will be
done.'"</p>

<p>"But," said Lethingtoun, "whair evir find ye onie of the
Propheitis so to haif pray it?"</p>

<p>"It sufficeth me," said the uther, "my Lord, that the Maister
and teicheare of bayth Prophettis and Appossillis hes
taucht me so to pray."</p>

<p>"But in so doing," said he, "ye put ane doute in the
peopillis heid of hir conversioun."<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a></p>

<p>"Nocht I, my Lord," said the uther, "but hir awin obstinat
rebellioune causis mo than me to doute of hir conversioun."</p>

<p>"Whairinto," said he, "rebellis sche aganis God?"</p>

<p>"In all the actiounis of hir lyffe," said he, "but in thir
two heidis especiallie; former, That sche will nocht heir the
preiching of the blissit evangill of Jesus Chryst; and secoundlie,
That sche menteinis that idoll, the Messe."</p>

<p>"Sche thinkis nocht that rebellioune," said Lethingtoun,
"but goode religion."</p>

<p>"So thocht thai," said the uther, "that sumtymes offerit
thair childerin unto Moloch, and yit the Spreit of God
affirmeis that thai offerit thame unto devillis, and nocht unto
God. And this day the Turkis thinkis to haif ane better religioune
than the Papistis haif; and yit, I think, ye will excuse
nether of thame boith from committing rebellioun aganis God:
nether yit justlie can ye do the Quene, onles that ye will mak
God to be parcyall."</p>

<p>"But yit," said Lethingtoun, "why pray ye nocht for hir
without moving onie doute?"</p>

<p>"Becaus," said the uther, "I haif leirnit to pray in faith.
Now Faith, ye know, dependis upoun the wordis of God, and
so it is that the word teichis me, that prayeris proffettis the
sonis and dochteris of Godis electioun, of which noumer,
quhether sche be ane or nocht, I haif just cause to doute;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
and, thairfoir, I pray God 'illuminat hir hairt, gif his gude
plesour be.'"</p>

<p>"But yit," said Lethingtoun, "ye can produce the exampill
of none that so hes prayit befoir you."</p>

<p>"Thairto I haif alreddy ansuerit," said Johne Knox; "but
yit for farther declaratioun, I will demand ane questioun,
quhilk is this, Quhider gif ye think that the Appossillis prayit
thame selves as thai commandit utheris to pray."</p>

<p>"Who douttis of that?" said the haill companie that wer
present.</p>

<p>"Weill than," said Johne Knox, "I am assureit that Peter
said thir wordis to Symoun Magus, 'Repent thairfoir of this
thy wyckitness, and pray to God, that gif it be possible the
thought of your hairt may be forgevin thee.' Heir we may
cleirlie see that Peter joynes ane conditioun with his commandiment,
That Symoun sould repent and pray, to wit, gif it
wer possible that his sin mycht be forgevin; for he wes nocht
ignorant that sum synnis wer unto the deith, and so without
all houpe of repentence or remissioun. And think ye nocht,
my Lord Secretar, (said he,) but the same doute may tuich
my hairt, as tuyching the Quenis conversioun, that then
tuiched the hairt of the Appossill?"</p>

<p>"I wald nevir," said Lethingtoun, "heir you or onie uther
call that in doubt."</p>

<p>"But your will," said the uther, "is no assurance to my conscience:
And to speik frelie, my Lord, I wonder gif ye your
self doute nocht of the Quenis conversioun; for more evident
signes of induratioun haif appeirit, and still do appeir in hir,
than Peter outwartlie could haif espyit in Symoun Magus.
For albeit sum tymes he wes are sorcerar, yit joynit he with
the Appossillis, belevit, and wes bapteissit; and albeit that the
venome of avarice remaneit in his hairt, and that he wald
haif bocht the Holie Goist, yit when he heard the feirfull
threitnyngis of God pronunceand aganis him, he trymbillitt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
desyreit the assistance of the prayeris of the Appossilis, and
so humblit him self, so far as the jugement of man could
perss, lyke ane true penitent, and yit we see that Peter douttis
of his conversioun. [Quhy then may not all the godly justly
doubt of the conversioun<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a>] of the Quene, wha hes usit idolatrie,
quhilk is no less odious in the sicht of God than is the other
and still continewis in the same, yea, that dispyseis all threitnyngis,
and refuisses all godlie admonitiounis?"</p>

<p>"Quhy say ye that sche refuisses admonitioun?" said Lethingtoun.
"She will glaidlie heir ony man."</p>

<p>"But what obedience," said the uther, "to God or to his
worde, ensewis of all that is spokin unto hir? Or when sall
sche be sene to gif hir presence to the publict preiching?"</p>

<p>"I think nevir," said Lethingtoun, "so lang as sche is thus
intreittit."</p>

<p>"And so lang," said the uther, "ye and all utheris maun
be content that I pray so as I may be assureit to be heard of
my God, that his gude will may be done, ether in making hir
comfortable to his Kirk, or gif that he hes appoyntit hir to be
ane scurge to the same, that we may haif patience, and sche
may be brydellit."</p>

<p>"Weill," said Lethingtoun, "lat us cum to the Secound
Heid. Whair find ye that the Scriptour callis onie the bound
slaiffis to Sathan? or that the Propheittis of God speik so irreverentlie
of kingis and princes?"</p>

<div class="sidenote10">ACTIS 26</div>

<div class="sidenote10">2 TIMO. 2</div>

<p>"The Scriptour," said Johne Knox, "sayis, that 'be natour
we are all the soneis of wraith.' Our Maister, Chryst Jesus,
affirmes, 'that sik as do sin ar servandis to sin,' and that it is
the onlie Son of God that settis men at freedome. Now what
difference thair is betwix the sonnis of wraith, and the servandis
of sin, and the slaiffis to the devill, I understand
nocht, except I be taught; and gif the scharpnes of the terme
offendit you, I haif nocht inventit that phrase of speich, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
haif leirnit it out of Godis Scriptour; for those wordis I find
spokin unto Paul, 'Behauld, I send thee to the Gentillis, to
oppin thair eyes, that thay may turn from darknes to lycht,
and from the power of Sathan unto God.' Mark thir wordis,
my Lord, and sture nocht at the speiking of the Holie Goist.
And the same Apostle wryting to his scoller Timotheus, says,
'Instruct with meiknes those that ar contrarie myndit, gif
that God at onie tyme will gif thame repentence, that thay
may knaw the treuth, and that thay may cum to amendment,
out of the snair of the Devill, quhilk ar tackin of him at his
will.' Gif your Lordschip rychtlie considder these sentences,
ye sall nocht onlie find my wordis to be the wordis of the
Holie Goist, but also the conditioune quhilk I use to adde, to
haif the assurance of Godis Scriptouris."</p>

<p>"But thay spak nothing aganis kingis in especiall," said
Lethingtoun, "and yit your continewall crying is, 'The Quenis
Idolatrie, the Quenis Messe, will provoke Godis vengeance.'"</p>

<p>"In the former sentences," said the uther, "I heir nocht
Kingis and Quenis excepit, but all unfaithfull ar pronunced to
stand in one rank, and to be in bondage to ane tyrant, the
Devill. But belyke, my Lord, ye lyttill regaird the estait
whairin thay stand, when ye wald haif thame so flatterit, that
the daingour thairfoir sould neither be knawin, neither yit
declareit to the poore peopill."</p>

<p>"Quhair will ye find," said Lethingtoun, "that onie of the
Propheittis did so intreat Kingis and Quenis, reuleris or magistratis?"</p>

<p>"In mo placeis than ane," said the uther. "Achab wes
ane King, and Jesabell wes ane Quene, and yit what the Prophet
Helias said to the one and to the uther, I suppois ye be
nocht ignorant?"</p>

<p>"That wes nocht cryit out befoir the peopill," said Lethingtoun,
"to mak thame odious unto thair subjectis."</p>

<p>"That Helias said, 'Doggis sail lyck the blude of Achab,'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
said Johne Knox, "'and eat the flesche of Jesabell,' the Scriptouris
assuris me; but that it wes whisperit in thair awin eir,
or in ane cornar, I reid nocht. But the plane contrair appeiris
to me, quhilk is, that boith the Peopill and the Court
understude weill eneuch what the Propheit had promeissit;<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a>
for so witnessit Jehu, efter that Godis vengeance had strickin
Jesabell."</p>

<p>"Thay wer singular motiounis of the Spreit of God," said
Lethingtoun, "and appertene nothing to this our aige."</p>

<p>"Then hes the Scriptour far dissavit me," said the uther;
"for Sanct Paule teichis me, that 'Whatsoevir is wryttin
within the Holie Scriptouris, the same is writtin for our instructioun,'
And my Maister said, that 'Everie leirnit and
wyise scribe bringis furth his tresour, baith thingis auld and
thingis new.' And the Propheit Jeremye affirmis, that 'Everie
realme and everie cytie that lykwyse offendis, as then did
Jerusalem, sould lykewyse be punischit.' Why then that the
factis of the ancient Propheittis, and the feirfull jugementis of
God executed befoir us upoun the disobedient, appertene nocht
unto this our aige, I neither see nor yit can understand. But
now, to put end to this heid, my Lord, (said he,) the Propheittis
of God hes nocht spairit to rebuke wickit kingis, alsweill
in thair face as befoir the pepill and subjectis. Elischa<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a>
feirit nocht to say to king Jehoram, 'What haif I to do with
thee? Get thee to the Propheittis of thy [Father, and to the
Propheittis of thy] Mother; for as the Lord of Hostis levis, in
quhose sicht I stand, gif it wer nocht that I regaird the presens
of Jehosaphat, the king of Juda, I wald nocht haif luikit
toward thee, nor sene thee.' Plane it is, that the Propheitt wes
ane subject in the kingdom of Israell, and yit how little reverence
he gevis to the King, we heir. Jeremye the Propheit
wes commandit to cry to the King and to the Quene, and to
say, 'Behaif your selfis lawlie; execute justice and jugement;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
or ellis your carcageis salbe eassin to the heit of the day, and
unto the froist of the nicht.' Unto Cononias, Sallum, and
Zedechias, he speikis in speciall, and schawis into tham, in his
publict sermoundis thair misserable endis; and thairfoir ye
aucht nocht to think it strainge, my Lord, (said he,) albeit that
the servandis of God mark the vice<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> of Kingis and Quenis,
evin als weill as of uther offendouris, and that because thair
synnis be moir noisum to the Commounwelth, than ar the
synnis of inferiour persounis."</p>

<p>The moist pairt of this ressounyng, Secretour Lethingtoun
leanit upoun the Maister of Maxwellis breist, who said, "I am
almoist werie: I wald that sum uther wald ressoun in the chief
heid, quhilk is nocht tuychit."</p>

<p>Then the Erle of Mortoune, Chancellour, commandit Mr.
George Hay to reassoun aganis Johne Knox, in the heid of
Obedience dew unto Magistratis; who began so to do. Unto
whom Johne Knox said, "Brother, that ye sall ressoun in my
contrair I am weill content, because I know you boith ane
man of leirnyng and of modestie: but that ye sall oppone
your self in the treuth whairof,<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> I suppoise, your awin conscience
is no less perswaded than is mine, I can nocht weill
approve; for I wald be sorie that I and ye suld be reputed to
ressoun as two scolleris of Pythagoras, to schaw the quicknes
of our ingyne, as it wer to ressoune on boith the pairtis. I
protest heir befoir God, that whatsoevir I sustene, I do the
same of conscience; yea, I dar no moir sustene ane propositioun
knawin unto my self untrew, than that I dar teich false
doctrine in the publict place: And thairfoir, Brother, gif conscience
move you to oppone your self to that doctrine, whilk
ye haif heard of my mouth in that maitter, do it bauldlie: it
sall nevir offend me. But that ye sall be found to oppone<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a>
your self unto me, ye being perswaidit in the same treuthe, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
say yit agane, it pleisses me nocht; for thairin may be gritter
inconvenient than either ye or I do considder for the present."</p>

<p>The said Mr. George ansuerit, "That I wald oppone my self
unto you as willing to impugn or confute that heid of doctrine,
whilk nocht onlie ye, but monie utheris, yea, and I my self haif
affirmit, far be it from me; for so sould I be found contrarious
to my self. For my Lord Secretour knawis my jugement in
that heid."</p>

<p>"Marye!" said the Secretour, "ye ar the weall worst of the
twa; for I remember weill your ressonyng whan the Quene
wes in Caryke."<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a></p>

<p>"Weill," said Johne Knox, "seing, Brother, that God hes
maid you to occupy the chyre of verittie, whairin, I assure,
we will aggrie in all principall heidis of doctrine, lat it nevir
be said that we disaggrie in disputatioun." Johne Knox wes
moved thus to speik, because he<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> understood moir of the craft
than the other did.</p>

<p>"Weill," said Lethingtoun, "I am sumwhat better provydeit
in this last heid, then I wes in the uther twa. Mr.
Knox, (said he,) yisterday we heard your jugement upoun the
13 to the Romanis; we heard the mynde of the Appossill weill
opened; we heard the causses why God hes establissed Poweris
upoun the earth; we heard the necessitie that mankynde hes
of the same; and we heard the deutie of Magistratis sufficientlie
declareit: But in two thingis I wes offendit, and I
think sum mo of my Lordis that than wer present. The ane
was, ye maid difference betwix the ordinance of God and the
persounis that wer placeit in authoritie; and ye affirmed, that
men mycht refuise<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> the persounis, and yit nocht to offend
againis Godis ordinance. This is the ane; the uther ye had
na tyme to explane; but this methocht ye menit, that subjectis
wer nocht bound to obey thair Princes gif thai commandit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
unlauchfull thingis; but that thai mycht resist thair
Princes, and wer nocht ever bound to suffer."</p>

<p>"In verie deid," said the uther, "ye haif rychtlie bayth
markit my wordis, and understand my mynd; for of that same
jugement I haif lang bene, and so yit I remane."</p>

<p>"How will ye prove your divisioun and difference," said
Lethingtoun, "and that the persoun placeit in authoritie may
be resistit, and Godis ordinance nocht transgressit, seing that
the Appossill says, 'He that resistis [the poweris,] resisteth the
ordinance of God.'"</p>

<p>"My Lord," said he, "the plane wordis of the Appossill
makis the difference, and the factis of many approved be God,
prove my affirmative. First, The Appossill affirmis, that the
poweris ar ordanit of God, [for the preservation of quyet and
peacebill men, and for the punischment of malefactours;
quhairof it is plane, That the ordinance of God,]<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> and the
power giffin unto man, is one thing, and the persone clad with
the power or with the authoritie, is ane uther; for Godis ordinance
is the conservatioun of mankynd, the punischment of
vyce, the mentenyng of vertew, quhilk is in it self holie, just,
constant, stable, and perpetuall. But men clad with the authoritie,
ar commounlie prophane and unjust; yea, thai ar mutabill
and transitorie, and subject to corruptioun, as God threitneth
thame be his Prophet David, saying, 'I haif said, Ye ar
godis, and everie one of you the sones of the Moist Heichest;
but ye sall die as men, and the princes sall fall like utheris.'
Heir I am assureit, that persounis, the saule and bodie of
wyckit Princes, ar threitnit with death: I think, that so ye
will nocht affirm is the authoritie, the ordinance and the
power, whairwith God hes indeuit sik persounis; for as I haif
said, as it is holie, so it is the permanent will of God. And
now, my Lord, that the Prince may be resistit, and yit the ordinance
of God nocht violatit, it is evident; for the peopill resistit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
Saule, when he had sworn be the leving God that Jonathan
sould die. The peopill, (I say,) swair in the contrair,
and delyverit Jonathan, so that ane hair of his heid fell nocht.
Now, Saule wes the anoyntit King, and thai wer his subjectis,
and yit thai so resisted him, that thai maid him no better
than mansworne."</p>

<p>"I doute," said Lethingtoun, "if in so doing the peopill did
weill."</p>

<p>"The Spreit of God," said the uther, "accuses thame nocht
of onie cryime, but rather praisses thame, and dampnis the
King, alsweill for his foolish vow and law maid without God,
as for his crewell mynd, that so seveirlie wald haif punischit
ane innocent man. But heirin I sall nocht stand: this that
followis sall confirm the former. This same Saule commandit
Abimelech and the Preistis of the Lord to be slane, becaus
thay had committit tressoune, as he allegit, for intercommuning
with David: His gaird and principall servandis walde
nocht obey his unjust commandiment; but Doeg the flatterar
put the Kingis creweltie to executioun. I will nocht ask your
jugement, Whidder that the servandis of the King, in nocht
obeying his commandiment, resisted God or nocht? or whidder
Doeg, in murthering the Preastis, gaif obedience to ane just
authoritie? for I haif the Spreit of God, speiking be the
mouth of David, to assure me of the one alsweill as of the
uther; for he, in his 52d Psalme, dampnis that fact as ane
moist crewell murther; and affirmis, that God wald punisch,
nocht onlie the commander, but the mercyles executour.
And thairfoir, I conclude, that thai who ganestand his commandiment,
resistit nocht the ordinance of God.</p>

<p>"And now, my Lord, to ansueir to the place of the Appossill,
who affirmis, 'That such as resistis the Power, resistis the
ordinance of God;' I say, that the power in that place is nocht
to be understande of the unjuste commandiment of men, but
of the just power whairwith God hes armit his Magistratis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
and Lievtenentis to punische syn, and mentene vertew. As gif
onie man sould interpryise to tak fra the handis of ane lauchful
juge ane murderare, ane adulterar, or onie [uther] malefactour
that be Godis law deserved deith, this same man resistit
Godis ordinance, and procureit to him self vengeance
and dampnatioune, because that he stayit Godis sworde<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> to

thame selfis to the furie and blynd rage of Princes; for
so thai resist nocht God, but the Devill, who abusis the swerd
and authoritie of God."</p>

<p>"I understand sufficientlie," said Lethingtoun, "what ye
mene; and to the one pairt I will nocht oppone<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> my self. But
I doute of the uther. For gif the Quene wald command me [to]
slay Johne Knox, because sche is offendit at him, I wald nocht
obey hir. But, and sche wald command utheris to do it, or
yit be ane collour of justice tak his lyffe fra him, I can nocht
tell gif I be found to defend him aganis the Quene and aganis
hir officiaris."</p>

<p>"Under protestatioun," said the uther, "that the auditour
think nocht that I seik favouris to my self,<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> I say, my Lord,
that gif ye be persuadeit of my innocency, and gif God hes
giffin unto you sik ane power and credyt as mycht deliver me,
and yit sufferit me to perisch, that in so doing ye soulde be
cryminall and gyltie of my blude."</p>

<p>"Prove that, and win the play," said Lethingtoun.</p>

<p>"Weill, my Lord," said the uther, "remember your promeis,
and I sail be schoirt of my probatioun. The Propheit Jeremey
wes apprehendit be Preistis and Prophettis, (who wer ane pairt
of the authoritie within Jerusalem,) and be the multitude of
the peopill, and this sentence wes pronunceit aganis him,
'Thou sall dey the deith; for thou hes said, This hous salbe
lyk Siloch, and this cytie salbe desolat without ane habitant.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
The Princes heiring the uprore, come from the Kingis hous,
and sit doune in jugement in the entrie of the new gait of the
Lordis hous, and thair the Preistis find the Prophettis befoir
the Princes, and befoir all the peopill, intendit thair accusatioun,
in these wordis, 'This man is worthie to dye, for he hes
propheissit aganis this cytie, as your eiris haif heard.' Jeremey
ansuerit, 'That whatsoevir he had spokin proceidit from
God; and thairfoir, (said he,) as for me, I am in your handis:
do with me as ye think gude and rycht: But knaw ye for certane,
that if ye put me to deith, ye sall surelie bring innocent
blude upoun your saulis,<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> and upoun this cytie, and upoun the

you, to speik all these wordis.' Now, my Lord, gif the Princes
and the hole peopill sould haif bene gyltie of the Propheittis
blude, how sall ye or utheris be jugeit innocent befoir God,
gif ye sall suffer the blude of sik as haif nocht deservit deith
to be sched, when that ye may save it?"</p>

<p>"The cases ar nothing lyke," said Lethingtoun.</p>

<p>"And I wald learn," said the uther, "whairin the dissymilitude
standis."</p>

<p>"First," said Lethingtoun, "the King had nocht condampnit
him to the deith. And nixt, the false Propheittis and the
Preistis and the peopill accuseit him without ane caus, and
thairfoir thai could nocht but be gyltie of his blude."</p>

<p>"Nether of these," said Johne Knox, "fechtis aganis my
argument; for albeit the King wes nether present, nor yit had
condampnit him, yit wer the princes and cheif counsallouris
thair sytting in jugement, who presentit the Kingis persoune
and authoritie, heiring the accusatioune laid unto the chairge
off the Propheit; and thairfoir he foirwairnis thame of the
dainger, as befoir I said, to wit, that in case he soulde be condampnit,
and so put to deith, that the King, the Counsell, and
the whole cytie of Jerusalem, soulde be gyltie of his blude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
becaus he had committit no cryme worthy of deith. And gif
ye think, that thai souldo haif bene all cryminall onelie, becaus
that thay all accuseit him, the plane text witnesses the contrair;
for the princes defendit him, and so no doute did a greit
pairt of the peopill; and yit he bauldlie affirmis, that thai
soulde be all gyltie of his blude gif that he soulde be put to
deith. And the propheit Ezechiell gifis the ressoune why all
are guilty of ane commoune corruptioune, 'Becaus,' sayis he,
'I socht ane man amangis thame that soulde mak [up] the
hedge, and stand in the gappe befoir me for the land, that I
soulde nocht distroy it, but I fand none; thairfoir, haif I
powrit my indignatioune upoun thame.' Heirof, my Lorde,
(said he,) it is plaine, that God craveis nocht onlie that a man
do no iniquittie in his awin persoune, but also that he oppone<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a>
him self to all iniquitie, sa far furth as into him lyis."</p>

<p>"Than will ye," said Lethingtoun, "mak subjectis to controlle
thair prynces and reuleris."</p>

<p>"And what harm," said the uther, "soulde the Commounewelth
ressaif, gif that the corrupt effectiounis off ignorant
reuleris wer moderatit, and so brydillit be the wisdome and
discretioun of godlie subjectis, that thai soulde do wrang nor
violence to no man?"</p>

<p>"All this ressonyng," said Lethingtoun, "is nocht of the
purpois; for we ressoune as gif the Quene soulde becum sik
an ennemye to oure religioune, that sche soulde persecute it,
and put innocent men to deith; whilk I am assureit sche nevir
thocht, nor nevir will do. For gif I soulde see hir begin at
that end, yea, gif I soulde suspect onie sik thing in hir, I
soulde be also far fordwarte in that argument as ye or onie
uther within this Realme: Bot thair is nocht sik ane thing.
Oure questioune is, Whidder that we may and aucht to suppres
the Quenis Messe? Or whidder hir Idolatrie salbe laid to
our chairge?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>"What ye may," said the uther, "be force, I disput nocht;
bot what ye may and aucht to do be Godis express commandiment,
that I can tell. Idolatrie aucht nocht [only] to be suppressit,
but the idolater aucht to dey the deith, unless that
we will accuse God."</p>

<p>"I knaw," said Lethingtoun, "the idolater is commandit
to dey the deith; but be whome?"</p>

<p>"Be the peopill of God," said the uther; "for the commandiment
wes gevin to Israell, as ye may reid, 'Heir, Israell,'
sayis the Lorde, 'the statutis and the ordinancis of the
Lord thy God,' &amp;c. Yea, ane [commandment] wes gevin, That
gif it be heard that idolatrie is committit in onie ane cytie, inquisitioune
salbe taikin; and gif it be founde trew, that than
the whole bodie of the peopill sall aryse and destroy that
cytie, spairing in it nether man, woman, nor chylde."</p>

<p>"But thair is no commandiment gevin to the peopill," said
the Secretour, "to punisch thair King gif he be ane idoliter."</p>

<p>"I find no moir privilege grantit unto Kingis," said the uther,
"be God, moir than unto the peopill, to offend Godis majestie."</p>

<p>"I grant," said Lethingtoun; "but yit the peopill may
nocht be jugeis unto thair King to punisch him, albeit he be
ane idolater."</p>

<p>"God," said the uther, "is the Universall Judge, alsweill
unto the King as to the peopill; so that what his worde commandis
to be punischit in the one, is nocht to be absolved in
the uther."</p>

<p>"We agree in that," said Lethingtoun; "but the peopill
may nocht execute Godis jugement, but man leif it unto him
self, who will either punische it be deith, be war, be emprisounment,
or be sum uther plaigis."<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a></p>

<p>"I knaw the last pairt of your ressoune," said Johne Knox,
"to be trew; but for the first, to wit, that the peopill, yea, or
ane pairt of the peopill may nocht execut God jugementis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>

<p>"Why say ye so?" said Lethingtoun, "I haif the jugementis

<p>"The moir pitie," said the uther, "and yit, what ye haif
proffeitit your awin cause, let utheris juge. But as for my

that Christianis soulde be subject to magistratis, or yit that
is lauchfull for ane Christiane to be ane magistrate; quhilk
opinioune I no less abhore than ye do, or onie uther that levis
do. The uthers speik of Christiane subjectis unto tyrantis
and infidellis, so dispersed that thai haif no uther force but
onlie to sobbe to God for delyverance. That sik indeid sould
haisard onie farder than these godlie men willis thame, I
can nocht haistellie be of counsell. But my argument hes ane
uther grounde; for I speik of the peopill assembled togidder in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
one bodie of ane Commounewelth, unto whome God hes gevin
sufficient force, nocht onlie to resyst, but also to suppres all
kynde of opin idolatrie: and sik ane peopill, yit agane I affirme,
ar bound to kepe thair land clene and unpollutit. And that
this my devissioune sall nocht appeir strange unto you, ye sall
understand, that God requyreit one thing of Abrahame and of
his seid, when he and thay wer strangeris and pilgremes in
Egipte and Canaan; and ane uther thing requyrit he of thame,
when thay wer delyverit fra the boundage of Egipt, and the
possessioune of the land of Canaan grantit unto thame. At the
first, and during all the tyme of thair boundage, God craveit
no moir but that Abraham soulde nocht defyle himself with
idolatrie. Nether wes he, nor yit his posterittie commandit to
distroy the idollis that wer in Canaan or in Egypt. But when
God gaif unto thame the possessioune of the land, he gaif unto
thame this strait commandiment, 'Bewar that you mak league
or confyderacye with the inhabitantis of this land: gif nocht
thy sonnis unto thair dochteris, nor yit gif thy douchteris unto
thair sonnis. But this sall ye do unto thame, cut downe thair
grovis, destroy thair imageis, brek doune thair altaris, and leif
thou no kynde of remembrance of those abominatiounis, whilk
the inhabitantis of the land useit befoir: for thou art ane holie
peopill unto the Lorde thy God. Defyle nocht thy self, thairwith,
with thair goddis.'</p>

<p>"To this same commandiment, I say, are ye, my Lordis, and
all sik as haif professit the Lorde Jesus within this Realme
bound. For God hes wrocht no less myrakill upoun you, baith
spirituall and corporall, than he did unto the carnell seid of
Abraham. For in what estait your bodyis, and this pure
Realme wes, within this sevin yeir, your selfis can nocht be
ignorant: You and it wer boith in boundage of ane strange
natioun; and what tyrrantis rang over your conscience, God
perchance may lat you feill, becaus that ye do nocht rychtlie
acknawlege the benefit ressavit. When oure pure Bretherin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>

But sen that God hes multipleyit knawlege, yea, and hes gevin

<p>Lethingtoun said, "In that poynt we will nevir agree; and
whair find ye, I pray you, that evir onie of the Prophettis or
of the Appossillis taucht sik ane doctrine, that the peopill
soulde be plaigit for the idolatrie of the prince; or yit, that the
subjectis mycht suppres the idolatrie of thair rewleris, or
punisch thame for the same?"</p>

<p>"What wes the commissioune giffin to the Appossillis," said
he, "my Lorde, we knaw: it wes to preche and plant the
Evangill of Jesus Chryste, whair darkness affoir had dominioune;
and thairfoir it behuifit thame, first to lat thame see the
lycht befoir that thay soulde will thame to put to thair handis
to suppress idolatrie. What preceptis the Appossillis gaif unto
the faythfull in perticular, other than that thai commandit all
to fley frome idolatrie, I will nocht affirme: But I find two
thingis quhilk the faithfull did; the one wes, thay assisted thair
preichouris, evin aganeis the reuleris and magistrates; the
other wes, thay suppressit idolatrie whairsoever God gaif unto
thame force, asking no leif at the Empriour, nor of his deputtis.
Reid the Ecclesiasticall Historie, and ye sall find cxampill sufficient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
And as to the doctrine of the Prophettis, we knaw thay
wer interpretouris of the law of God; and we knaw thay spak
alsweill to the kingis as to the peopill. I reid that nether of
boith wald heir thame; and thairfoir come the plaig of God
upoun boith. But that thai more flatterit Kingis than that thay
did the peopill, I can nocht be persuadit. Now, Godis lawis
pronunces deith, as befoir I haif said, to idolateris withoute
exceptioune of onie persoune: Now, how the Propheittis coulde
rychtlie interpret the law, and schew the causes of Godis jugementis,
quhilk evir thay threitned soulde follow idolatrie, and
for the rest of abominatiounis that accumpaney it, for it is
nevir alone; but still corrupt religioune bringis with it ane
fylthie and corrupt lyfe: How, I say, the Propheittis coulde
reprove the vyces, and nocht schaw the peopill thair dewtie, I
understand nocht; and thairfoir I constantlie beleif that the
doctrine of the Prophettis wes so sensible, that the Kingis
understude thair awin abhominatiounis, and the peopill understude
what thay aucht to haif done, in punisching and repressing
thame. But becaus that the moist pairt of the pepill wer no
less rebellious unto God than wer thair princes, thairfoir the
ane and the uther conveineit aganis God and aganis his servandis.
And yit, my Lord, the factis of sum Propheittis ar so
evident, that thairof we may collect what doctrine thay taucht;
for it war no small absurdity to affirme that thair factis
soulde repugn to their doctrine."</p>

<p>"I think," said Lethingtoun, "ye meane of the historie of
Jehu. What will ye prove thairby?"</p>

<p>"The cheif heid," said Johne Knox, "that ye deny, to wit,
That the Propheittis nevir taucht that it appertenit to the
peopill to punisch the idolatrie of thair Kingis; the contrair
whairof I affirm: And for the probatioun, I am reddie to produce
the fact of ane Propheit; for ye knaw, my Lord, said he,
that Eliseus send one of the childrene of the Propheittis to
anoynt Jehu, who gaif him in commandiment to destroy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
hous of his maister Achab for the idolatrie commitit be him,
and for the innocent blude that Jesabell his wyckit wyff had
sched: quhilk he obeyit, and pat in full execution; for the
quhilk God promessit unto him the stabillatie of the kingdom
to the fourt generation. Now, said he, heir is the fact of ane
Propheit, that proveis that subjectis wer commandit to execute
jugementis upoun thair King and Prince."</p>

<p>"Thair is eneuch," said Lethingtoun, "to be ansuerit thairto;
for Jehu wes ane King befoir he pat onie thing in executioun;
and besydis this, the fact is extraordinaire, and aucht
nocht to be imitat."</p>

<p>"My Lord," said the uther, "he wes ane meir subject, and
no King whan the Propheittis servand came unto him; yea,
and albeit that his fellow capitanis, heiring of the message,
blew the trumphet, and said, 'Jehu is king;' yit I doute
nocht, but Jesabell boith thocht and said, 'He wes ane traitour;'
and so did monie utheris that wer in Israell and in Samaria.
And as tuiching that ye allege, that the fact wes extraordinarie,
and is nocht to be imitat, I say, that it had
ground of Godis ordinary jugement, whilk commandis the idolater
to dey the deith; and, thairfoir, I yit agane affirme, that
it is to be imitat of all those that prefferis the true honour,
the true worschip and glorie of God, to the affectiounis of
flesch, and of wickit Princes."<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a></p>

<p>"We ar nocht bound to imitat extraordinarie exampillis,"
said Lethingtoun, "unles we haif the lyke commandiment and
assurance."</p>

<p>"I grant," said the uther, "gif the exampill repugn to the
law; and gif ane avaricious and deceitfull man wald borrow
[gold,] silver, rayment, or [ony] uther necessaris from his
nychtbour, and withhauld the same, alledging, that so thay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
mycht do and nocht offend God, because that the Iseraellitis
did so to the Egiptianis at thair depairtour furth of Egipt.
The exampill served to no purpoise unles that thai coulde
produce the lyke cause, and the lyke commandiment that the
Iseraellitis had, and that because thair fact repugnit to this
commandiment of God, 'Thou sall nocht steill.' But whair
the exampill aggreis with the law, and is, as it wer, the executioun
of Godis jugementis expressit in the same, I say, that
the exampill approved of God standis to us in place of a commandiment:
for, as God of his natour is constant, immutable,
sa can he nocht dampne in the aigis subsequent, that whilk
he hes approvit in his servandis befoir us. But in his servandis
befoir us, He be his awin commandiment hes approvit,
that subjectis hes nocht onlie distroyit thair Kingis for idolatrie,
but also hes ruitit out thair hoill posteritie, so that none
of that race wes left efter to impyre above the peopill of God."</p>

<p>"Whatsoevir thai did," said Lethingtoun, "wes done at
Godis commandiment."</p>

<p>"That fortifeis my argument," said the uther; "for be
Godis commandiment he approvit, that subjectis punish thair
Princes<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> for idolatrie and wickitness be thame committit."</p>

<p>"We haif nocht the lyke commandiment," said Lethingtoun.</p>

<p>"That I deny," said the uther; "for the commandiment,
'The idolater sall dey the deith,' is perpetuall, as [ye] your
self hes grantit: You douttit onlie who sould be executouris
againis the King; and I said the peopill of God, and hes sufficientlie
provin, as I think, that God hes raissit up the peopill,
and by his Propheit hes anoyntit ane King to tak vengeance
upoun the King, and upoun his posteritie. Quhilk fact, God
sen that tyme hes nevir retreittit; and, thairfoir, to me it remanis
for ane constant and cleane commandiment to all the
peopill professing God, and haifing the power to punisch vyce,
what thay aucht to do in the lyke caise. Gif the peopill had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
interprysit onie thing without Godis commandiment, we mycht
haif doutit whidder thai had done weill or evill; but seing
that God did bring the execution of his law agane in practice,
efter that it wes cum in oblivioun and contempt, what ressonable
man can doute now of Goddis will, unles we will doute of
all thingis quhilk God renewis nocht unto us be miracallis, as
it wer from age to age. But I am assureit, that the ansuer of
Abraham unto the riche man, who being into hell, desyreit that
Lazarus, or sum of the deid, sould be send unto his bretherin
and freindis, to foirwairne thame of his incredable [pane and]
tormentis, and that thay sould behaif thame selfis, so that thai
sould nocht cum in that place of torment: the ansuer, I say,
gevin unto him, sall confound sik as craif farder approbatioun
of Godis will then is alreddy expressit within his holie Scriptouris;
for Abraham said, 'Thay haif Moyses and the Propheittis,
whome gif thay will nocht beleif, neither will thay
beleif albeit that one of the deid sould ryise.' Evin so, I say,
my Lord, that sik as will nocht be taucht what thay aucht to
do, be commandiment of God anis gevin, and anis put in practice,
will nocht beleif nor obey, albeit that God sould send
angellis from hevin to instruct that doctrine."</p>

<p>"Yis," said the uther; "when the factis<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> of men aggrie with
the law of God, and ar rewairdit according to Godis awin promeise,
expressit in his law, I say, that the prosperitie succeiding
the fact is moist infallable assurance that God hes approvit
that fact. Now so it is, that God hes promeissit in his law, that
when his peopill sall exterminat and destroy sik as declyne
from him, that he will bliss thame, and multipley thame, as
he hes promeissit unto thair fatheris. But so it is, that Amasias
turneit fra God; for so the text do witness; and plane it is
the peopill slew thair king; and lyke plane it is, that God
blissit thame: Thairfoir, yit agane conclude I, that God approvit
thair fact, in so far as it wes done according to his commandiment,
wes blissit according to his promeise."</p>

<p>"Weill," said Lethingtoun, "I think nocht the ground sa
sure as I durst builde my conscience thairupoun."</p>

<p>"I pray God," said the uther, "that your conscience haif no
worse ground than is this, when soevir ye sall begin that lyke
work whilk God in your awin eis hes alreddie blessit. And
now, my Lord, (said he,) I haif but one exampeill to produce,
and than I will put [an] end to my ressonying, becaus I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
wearie langer to stand." (Commandiment wes gevin that he
sould sytt doune; but he refuissit it, and said, "Melancholius<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a>
ressouns wald haif sum myrth intermixed.") "My last exampill,
(said he,) my Lord, is this:&mdash;Uzzias the King, nocht content of
his royal estait, malepeirtlie tuk upoun him to enter within the
temple of the Lord, to burne incense upoun the alter of incense;
'And Azarias the preist went in efter him, and with him
fourscore preistis of the Lord, vailzeant men, and thay withstude
Uzzias the king, and said unto him, It pertenith thee
nocht, Uzzias,<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> to burne incense unto the Lord, but to the
preistis, the sonnis of Aaroune, that ar consecratit to offer
incense: Go furth of the sanctuary, for thou hes transgressit,
and you sall haif no honour of the Lord God.' Heirof, my
Lord, I conclude, that subjectis nocht onlie may, but also
aucht to withstand and resist thair princes, whensoever thay
do onie thing that expreslie repugnis to God, his law, or holie
ordinance."</p>

<p>"Thay that withstude the King," said Lethingtoun, "wer
nocht sempill subjectis, but wer the Preistis of the Lord, and
figoureis of Chryste, and sik preistis haif we none this day, to
withstand Kingis gif thay do wrang."</p>

<p>"That the Hye Preist wes the figour of Chryste," said the
uther, "I grant: but that he wes nocht ane subject, that I
deny. For I am assureit, that he in his priestheid had no prerogative
above those that had passit befoir him. Now, so it is,
that Aaroune wes subject unto Moyses, and callit him his
Lord. Samuell, being boith propheit and preist, subject him
self to Saule, eftor he wes inaugurat of the peopill. Sadock
bowit befoir David; and Abiathar wes depossit frome the
preistheid be Salamoune, quhilkis all confessit thame selfis
subjectis to the Kingis, albeit that thairwith thei ceissit nocht
to be the figouris of Christe. And whairas ye say, that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
haif no sik preistis this day, I mycht answer, that nether haif
we sik Kingis this day as than wer annoyntit at Godis commandiment,
and sat upoun the sait of David, and wer no les
the figour of Chryste Jesus in thair juste administratioun,
then wer the preistis in thair appoyntit office: and sik Kingis,
I am assureit, we haif nocht now moir than that we haif sik
preistis: for Chryste Jesus being annoyntit in our natour, of
God his Father, both King, Priest, and Prophet, hes put an
end to all externall unctioune. And yit, I think, ye will nocht
say, that God hes now diminissit his graceis for those whome
he appoyntis ambassadouris betwix him and his peopill, [more]
than that he dois from kingis and princes; and thairfoir, why
that the servandis of Jesus Chryste may not also justlie withstand
kingis and princes, that this day no less offendit Godis
majestie than Uzzias did, I see nocht, onless that ye will say,
that we, in the brychtnes of the Evangill, ar nocht sa straitlie
bound to regaird Godis glorie, nor yit his commandimentis,
as wer the fatheris that leiffit under the dark schaddowis of
the Law."</p>

<p>"Weill," said Lethingtoun, "I will dip no farder in that
heid. But how resisted the Preistis the King? Thai onelie
spak unto him without farder violence intendit."</p>

<p>"That thay withstude him," said the other, "the text
assureis me; but that thay did nothing but speik, I can nocht
understand; for the plane text affirms the contrair, to wit, that
thay caused him haistilie to depairt frome the sanctuarie, yea,
and that he wes compellit to depairt: quhilk maner of speiking,
I am assureit in the Hebrew toung impoirtis uther thing
than exhoirting, or commanding by worde."</p>

<p>"Thay did that," said Lethingtoun, "efter that he wes
espyit leaprous."</p>

<p>"Thay withstude him hefoir," said the other; "but yit
thair last fact confermes my propositioune so evidentlie, that
sik as will oppone thame unto it, moist neidis oppone thame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
unto God; for my assertioun is, that kingis haif no previlege
moir than has the peopill to offend Godis majestie; and gif that
so thay do, thay ar no moir exempted from the punischment of
the law than is onie uther subject; yea, and that subjectis
may nocht onlie lauchfullie oppone thame selfis to thair kingis,
whensoevir thay do onie thing that expressedlie repugnes to
Goddis commandiment, but also that thay may execute jugement
upoun thame according to Goddis law; so that [if] the
king be ane murtherar, adulterar, or idolater, he soulde suffer
according to Godis law, nocht as ane king, but as ane offender,
and that the peopill may put Godis lawis in executioune, this
Historie cleirlie proveis: for how soon that the leprosie appeirit<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a>
in his foirheid, he wes nocht onelie compellit to depairt
oute of the sanctuarie, but also he was removeit frome all
publick socyetie and administratioune of the kingdome, and
wes compellit to dwell in ane house ane pairt, evin as the law
commandit, and gat no grytter privilage in that cais than onie
uther of the peopill soulde haif done; and this wes executit
be the peopill; for it is no doute mo wer witnesses of his
leprossie than the preistis allone. But we fynd none oppone
thame selfis to the sentence of God pronounced in his law
aganis the leprouse; and thairfoir, yit agane say I, that the
peopill aucht to execute Goddis law evin aganis thair princes,
when that thair oppin crymes be Godis law deserve deith, but
especialie when thay ar sik as may infect the rest of the multitude.
And now, my Lordis, (said he,) I will ressoune no
langer, for I haif spokin moir than I intendit."</p>

<p>"And yit," said Lethingtoun, "I can nocht tell what can
be concludit."</p>

<p>"Albeit ye can nocht," said the uther, "yit I am assureit
what I haif provin, to wit:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. That subjectis haif delyverit ane innocent frome the
handis of thair King, and thairintill offendit nocht God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>"2. That subjectis haif refuseit to stryke innocentis whan

<p>"3. That sik as struck at the commandiment of the King

<p>"4. That God hes nocht onlie of ane subject maid ane
King, but also hes airmit subjectis aganis thair naturall Kings,
and commandit thame to tak vengence upoun thame according
to his law.</p>

<p>"And, last, That Godis pepill hes executit Godis law aganis
thair King, having no farther regaird to him in that behalf,
than gif he had bene the moist simpill subject within this
Realme.</p>

<p>"And thairfoir, albeit ye will not understand what sould be
concludeit, yit I am<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> assureit that nocht onlie Goddis pepill
[may], but also, that thai ar bounde to do the same whair the
lyke crymes ar committit, and when he gevis unto thame the
lyke power."</p>

<p>"Weill," said Lethingtoun, "I think ye sall nocht haif
monie leirnit men of your oppinioun."</p>

<p>"My Lord," said the uther, "the treuthe ceisses nocht to
be the treuthe, howsoevir it be that men [either] misknaw it,
or yit ganestand it. And yit, (said he,) I praise my God, I
lack nocht the consent of Godis servandis in that heid." And
with that he presentit unto the Secretour the Apologie of
Magdeburgh;<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> and willit him to reid the names of the Mynisteris
who had subscribed the defence of the Toune to be ane
moist juste defence; and thairwith addit, "That to resist ane
tyrant, is not to resist God, nor yit his ordinance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>Whilk when he had read, he scripped and said, "<i>Homines
obscuri</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> The uther ansuerit, "<i>Dei tamen servi</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a></p>

<p>And [so] Lethingtoun arose and said, "My Lordis, ye
haif hard the ressounis upoun boith pairteis: it becumis you
now to decyde, and [to] put ane ordour unto preicheouris,
that thay may be uniforme in doctrine. May we, think ye,
tak the Queenis Messe frome hir?"</p>

<p>Whille that sum began to geif thair voittis, for sum wer
appoyntit, as it wer, leaderis to the rest, Johne Knox said, "My
Lordis, I suppois that ye will nocht [do] contrair to your
[Lordships] promeis, maid to the whole Assemblie, whilk wes,
That nothing soulde be voited in secreit, till that the first all
maitteris soulde be debaittit in publict, and that than the
voittis of the whole Assemblie sould put an end to the controversie.
Now haif I onelie sustenit the argument, and haif
rather schawin my conscience in moist simpill maner, than
that I haif insystit upoun the force and vehemence of onie ane
argument: And thairfoir I, for my pairt, utterlie disassent
frome all voitting, till that the whole Assemblie haif hard the
propositiounis and the ressounis of boith pairteis. For I unfeinyeitlie
acknawlege, that monie in this cumpanie ar moir
abill to sustene the argument than I am."</p>

<p>"Think ye it reasonable," said Lethingtoun, "that sik ane
multitude [as] ar now convenit, soulde ressoune and voit in
these heidis and matteris that concerne the Quenis Majesties
awin persoune and effairis?"</p>

<p>"I think," said the uther, "that whatsoevir soulde bind,
the multitude soulde heir, unless that thai haif resignit thair
power unto thair Commissioneris, whilk thai haif nocht done,
sua far as I understand; for my Lord Justice-Clark heard
thame with ane voice say, That in no wayis wald thai consent
that onie thing soulde ether here be voited or concludit."</p>

<p>"I can nocht tell," said Lethingtoun, "[if] that my Lordis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
that be heir present, and that beir the burding of sik maitteris,
soulde be bounde to thair will. What say ye, (said he,) my
Lordis? Will ye voit in this maitter, or will ye nocht voit?"</p>

<p>Efter lang ressonyng, sum that wer maid for the purpois
said, "Why may nocht the Lordis voit, and than schaw unto
the Kirk whatsoevir is done?"</p>

<p>"That appeiris to me," said Johne Knox, "nocht onlie ane
backwart ordour, but also ane tyrranie usurpeit upoun the
Kirk: But for me, do as ye list, (said he,) for as I ressoune, so
I voit; yit protesting as befoir, that I dissent frome all voiting,
till that the hoill Assemblie understand alsweill the questiounis
as the ressonyngis."</p>

<p>"Weill," said Lethingtoun, "that can nocht be done now,
for the tyme is spent; and thairfoir, my Lorde Chanceler,
(said he,) ask ye the voittis, and tak [be course] everie ane of
the Mynisteris, and ane of us."</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. JOHNE

<p>And so wes the Rectour of Sanctandrois<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> commanded first to

<p>At last, Mr. Johne Craig,<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> fellow-minister with Johne Knox

toune, I saw in the tyme of thair Generall Assemblie this
Conclusioun set furth: This same I hard ressoned, determined,
and concludit:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Conclusio.</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Principes</span> omnes, tam supremi, quam inferiores, possunt
et debent reformari, vel deponi per eos, per quos eliguntur,
confirmantur, vel admittuntur ad officium, quoties a fide
præstita subditis per juramentum deficiunt: Quoniam relatio
juramenti subditorum et principum mutua est, et
utrinque æquo jure servanda et reformanda, juxta legem
et conditionem juramenti ab utraque parte facti."</p></blockquote>

<p>"That is, All Reuleris, be thay supreame or be thay inferiour,
may and aucht to be reformed or deposed be thame be
whom thay ar chosin, confirmed, or admitted to thair office,
as oft as thay brak that promeis maid be the oath to thair
subjectis: Because that thair Prince is no less bound be oath
to the subjectis, then is the subjectis to thair Princeis, and
thairfoir aucht to be keipit and reformed equallie, according
to the law and conditioun of the oath that is maid of other
partie."</p>

<p>"This Conclusioun, my Lordis, I heard sustenit and concludit,
as I haif said, in ane moist notabill auditour. The
sustenar wes ane leirnit man, M. Thomas de Finola, the Rectour
of the Universitie, ane man famous in that cuntrie. Magister
Vincentius de Placentia, affirmed the Conclusioun to be
moist true and certane, agreable boith with the law of God
and man. The occasioun of this Disputatioun and Conclusioun,
wes ane certene disordour and tyrranie that wes attempit
be the Paipes Governouris, who began to mak innovationis
in the cuntrie aganis the lawis that wer befoir establischit,
alledging thame selfis nocht to be subject to sik lawis,
be ressoune that thay wer nocht institute be the peopill, but
be the Paip, who wes King of that cuntrie; and, thairfoir
thay, haifing full commissioun and authoritie of the Paip,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
mycht alter and change statuteis and ordinanceis of the cuntrie,
without all consent of the peopill. Aganis this [thair]
usurped tyrranie, the leirnit and the peopill opponcit thame
selffis opinlie: and when that all ressounis whilk the Paipis
governouris could allege wer heard and confuted, the Paip
him self wes fane to tak up the maitter, and to promeis to
keip nocht onlie the lybertie of the peopill, but also that he
sould neither abrogat<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> onie law [or] statute, neither yit mak
onie new law without thair awin consent. And, thairfoir, my
Lord, (said he,) my vote and consience is, that Princes ar nocht
onlie bound to keip lawis and promeisses to thair subjectis,
but also, that in caise thai faill, thay justlie may be deposeit;
for the band betwix the Prince and the Peopill is reciproce."</p>

<p>Then start [up] ane claw-back of that corrupt Court, and
said, "Ye wat nocht what ye say; for ye tell us what wes
done in Bononia; we ar ane kingdome, and thai ar but ane
Commounwelth."</p>

<p>"My Lord," said he, "my jugement is, that everie kingdom
is, or at leist, sould be ane Commounwelth, albeit that everie
Commounwelth be nocht ane kingdom; and, thairfoir, I think,
that in ane kingdom no less dylligence aucht to be taikin, that
lawis be nocht violatit, than is [in] ane Commounwelth; because
that the tyrranie of Princeis who continwallie ring<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> in
ane kingdom, is moir hurtfull to the subjectis, than is the misgovernment
of those that from yeir to yeir ar chaingit in fre
Commounwelthis. But yit, my Lordis, to assure you and all
utheris farder, that heid wes disputed be the utermoist; and
than, in the end, it was concludit,<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> that thay spak nocht of sik
thingis as wer done in diverse kingdomis and natiounis be tyrranie
and negligence of peopill. 'But we conclude,' said thai,
'what aucht to be done in all Kingdomis and Commounwelthis,
according to the law of God, and unto the just lawis of man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
And gif be the negligence of the peopill, or be tyrranie of
Princes, contrair lawis haif bene maid, yit may that same
peopill, or thair posteritie, justlie craif all thingis to be reformed,<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a>
according to the originall institutioun of Kingis and Commounwelthis:
and sik as will nocht [do] so, deserve to eit the
frute of thair awin folischnes.'"</p>

<p>Maister James Makgill,<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> than Clark of Register, persaifing
the voittis to be different, and heiring the bauld plainess of
the foirsaid servand of God, said, "I remember that this same
questioun wes lang debaittit aneis befoir this in my house,
and thair, be ressoune that we wer nocht all of ane mynd, it
wes concludit, that Mr. Knox sould in all our names haif
writtin to Mr. Calvin for his jugement in the contraversie."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Mr. Knox, "my Lord Secretour wald nocht
consent that I sould wrytte, alleging, that the grittest weycht
of the ansuer stude in the narrative, and thairfoir [promeisit
that] he wald wryte, and I sould sey it. But when, (said he,)
that diverse tymes I requyreit him to remember his promeis,
I fand no thing but delay."</p>

<p>Whairto the Secretour did ansuer, "True it is, I promeist
to wryte, and true it is, that diverse tymeis Mr. Knox
requyreit me so to do. But when I had moir deiplie consydderit
the weycht of the maitter, I began to find mo douttis
than that I did befoir, and this one amangis utheris, How I
durst, I being ane subject, and the Quenis Majesties Secretarie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a>
tak upoun me to seik resolutioun of contraverseyis depending
betwix hir Heyness and hir subjectis, without hir awin knawlege
and consent." Than wes thair ane acclamatioun of the
claw-backis of the Courte, as if Apollo had gevin his response:
It wes wyselie and faythfullie done.</p>

<p>"Weill," said Johne Knox, "let warldlie men praise warldlie
wisdome so heichlie as thay pleise, I am assureit, that be sik
shiftis, idolatrie is mentenit, and the treuth of Jesus Chryste is
betrayit, whairof God one day will be revengit." At this, and
the lyke scherpnes, monie offendit, the voitting ceissit, and
everie factioun began planelie to speik as effectioun moveit
thame.</p>

<p>Johne Knox in the end wes commandit yit to wryte to
Mr. Calvin, and to the leirnit in uther Kirkis, to knaw thair
jugementis in that questioune; quhilk he refuissit, schawing
his ressoun, "I myself am nocht onlie fullie resolved in conscience,
but also I haif heard the jugementis in this, and all
uther thingis that I haif affirmit within this Realme, of the
moist godlie and moist leirnit that be knawin in Europe. I come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>

assurance I haif the hand wrytingis of monie; and, thairfoir,
gif I sould [now] move the same questioun agane, what sould
I do uther, but either schaw my awin ignorance and forgetfulness,
or ellis inconstancey: And, thairfoir, it may pleise
you to appardoune me, albeit I wryte nocht. But I will teich

<h2>THE FIFTH BOOK OF THE REFORMATION OF
THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND.</h2>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>
<h2>INTRODUCTORY NOTICE TO BOOK FIFTH.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the previous volume it has been shewn that the Four
Books of <span class="smcap">The History of the Reformation in Scotland</span> were
written by Knox, between the years 1559 and 1566; and that
these Books have reached us, as completed by himself, without
being either mutilated or interpolated, except in the common
printed editions of the work. But of the Fifth Book, no manuscript
copy has been discovered; and although there may be
sufficient reason to prevent us from ascribing its composition to
the Scotish Reformer, there can be no doubt of the propriety of
annexing it as a Supplement or Continuation of his History.</p>

<p>This Fifth Book relates to the progress of affairs in Scotland,
from September 1564 to August 1567, when Queen Mary
having been forced to abdicate the throne, the Earl of Murray
was appointed Regent. It was first published in folio, in the
year 1644, by <span class="smcap">David Buchanan</span>, a person of literary distinction,
of whom some account will be given in the Appendix to
the present volume. The volume has this title:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The Historie of the Reformation of the Church of
Scotland</span>; Containing five Books: Together with some <span class="smcap">Treatises</span>
conducing to the History. Published by Authority.
(Jerem. 5. 1.-2 Cor. 13. 8.) <span class="smcap">London</span>, Printed by <i>John Raworth</i>,
for <i>George Thomason</i> and <i>Octavian Pullen</i>, and are to be
sold at the Signe of the Rose in <i>Paul's</i> Church-yard. <small>MDCXLIV.</small>"</p>

<p>In the course of the same year, another edition, in quarto,
appeared under a similar title:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">The Historie</span>, &amp;c. Printed
at <span class="smcap">London</span> for <i>G. T.</i> and <i>O. P.</i> And Re-Printed at <span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>
by <span class="smcap">Robert Bryson</span>, and are to be sold at his Shop at
the Signe of <span class="smcap">Jona</span>. 1644."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>It is a mistake to suppose that this Edinburgh edition was
a literal reprint. The greater portion of the volume is in fact
so, insomuch that the words and letters in most of the lines
correspond in the two editions; still there are some changes
which it is not improbable were introduced under Buchanan's
immediate inspection. The Preface "To the Reader," in
which the Editor "D. B." says, "I have thought fit in this
place to point at some main occurrences from that time (1567)
till now," remains unaltered. But "The Life of John Knox,"
which fills eight pages in the folio edition, is extended as
"The Life and Death of John Knox," in the quarto, to twenty-two
pages, including "An Acrostick" (8 lines), and 16 lines
in the shape of an altar, "To the pretious memorie of John
Knox, that worthie Primitive-Reformer in the Church of Scotland,"
signed "J. L." The historical "Preface," relating to
the earlier people and religion of Scotland, filling thirty leaves
in the folio, and thirty-two leaves in the quarto edition, contains
no alterations. Neither are there any of importance,
until we reach the close of Book Fourth, where four paragraphs
are added, two of them being transposed from the commencement
of Book Fifth. Other additions occur towards the
latter part of Book Fifth. And in the subjoined Treatises,
there is added Knox's "Brief Exhortation," dated from Geneva,
12th January 1557.</p>

<p>The passage in Buchanan's Life of John Knox, in which he
speaks of the <span class="smcap">History Of The Reformation</span>, is worthy of notice.
After mentioning Knox's education and earnest study of
the Holy Scriptures, he refers to his sufferings, and says, "For
the cause of the truth, he suffered very much by sea and land,
in minde and body; among forraigners, and amongst his own
countreymen, as ye may see in this History of the Church,
which now here we present unto you: Which History, namely
so much of it, I mean, as formerly was published, hath gone
commonly under his name, because he is the man of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
most is spoken thorowout the whole History, as being a most
earnest and diligent agent in the businesse of the Reformation
in the Church: Next, because he hath penned with his own
hand, or spoken by word of mouth, the most part of the most
remarkable and most usefull things for Posterity in the History.
Thirdly, the whole History is gathered out of his Papers
and Manuscripts: And so ye see why it is generally received
to be of <span class="smcap">John Knox</span>. But to return to his Life," &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the Edinburgh edition, this reference to the History is
altered as follows:&mdash;after mentioning that Knox "was honoured
to be one of the prime publike actors in that worthy
worke of our Primitive Reformation," Buchanan says, "And
because some singular fruit, more then ordinare, is expected
from him who hes some singular enduements, more then ordinar:
Therefore, to shew to the world how farre his thoughts
were bussied upon the good of Posteritie, and how little he did
live to himselfe, he brought out of the intrals of actions many
choise and worthie secrets, as the laudable travels of his pious
and judicious minde, the truth whereof is evidentlie apparent
throughout the whole progresse of this Church-Historie, which
may justly bee published and sent abroad under his name, because
the most part thereof hath either been penned with his
owne hand, or spoken and uttered by the word of his mouth,
or gathered and collected out of his Papers and Manuscripts.
His Historicall relations are without partialitie. Hee hated no
man's person, no not the enemie but his sin. And therefore
I hope his unpartiall expressions shall be unseasonable to no
good man, be hee never so great. Wearie not then in reading,
but adventure your patience as he hes done his paines, and I
doubt not, but in each particular, you shall get such a full and
satisfactorie information of the truth, that you shall not afterward
need to strike fire, and light your candle at another man's
Torch. But to returne to his Life," &amp;c.</p>

<p>In regard to the authorship of this Fifth Book, the minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
statement of facts, the occasional modes of expression, and the
above declaration by the Editor, that "the whole History is
gathered out of Knox's Papers and Manuscripts," are quite opposed
to the general notion that it was written or even compiled
by David Buchanan. Neither can we attribute it to Knox's Secretary,
Richard Bannatyne, as the style is altogether unlike
that of the "Journal of Transactions" from 1570 to 1573, which
has been published under his name; and from which portions
at least ought to be included in a collection of the Reformer's
Works. This will form part of the concluding volume.</p>

<p>On this subject the Editor of 1732, after remarking, "It is
not easy to give any tolerable account of the Fifth Book," says,
"It seems probable that Mr. David Buchanan himself is the
author of it: perhaps he was beholden to Mr. Knox's scrolls,
but I wish he had carefully distinguished Mr. Knox's composure
from his own, and forborn his interpolations in the body of
the History, which is a liberty no person ought to take with
any Author.... The Editors, (it is added;) have given
the Fifth Book as Mr. Buchanan has published it, and leave it
to the Reader to value it as he finds cause." But these Editors
have taken an unusual liberty, which they have not specified,
in altering the language to correspond to the more antiquated
orthography of the Glasgow MS. of the Four Books. In the
present edition, the text is given from that of London, 1644.</p>

<p>Although persuaded that the Fifth Book has been chiefly derived
from Knox's papers by some unknown hand, yet, as it
has no well-founded claims to be regarded as <small>A WORK OF ORIGINAL
AUTHORITY</small>, like the previous Books, I have not thought it
necessary to devote much time to its elucidation by encumbering
the pages with foot-notes; and the more so, as the period
of three years which it embraces, has been so fruitful in controversy,
and has obtained a much larger share of literary
investigation than perhaps any other period of our National
History.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span><span class="smcap">In</span> the next moneth, which was July, the Queen went into
Athole to the hunting; and from thence she made her progress
into Murray, and returned to Fyfe in September.<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> All
this while there was appearance of love and tender friendship
betwixt the two Queens; for there was many letters full of
civility and complements sent from either of them to the other
in signe of amity; besides costly presents for tokens. And in
the meantime the Earl of Lenox<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> laboured to come home forth
of England; and in the moneth of October he arrived at Halyrud-House,
where he was graciously received by the Queen's
Majestie; namely, when he had presented the Queen of
England her letters, written in his favour: And because he
could not be restored to his lands without Act of Parliament,
therefore there was a Parliament procured to be holden at
Edinburgh, the 13. day of December:<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> But before the Queen
would cause to proclaim a Parliament, she desired the Earle of
Murray, by whose means chiefly the said Earle of Lenox came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
into Scotland, That there should no word be spoken, or at
least concluded, that concerned Religion in the Parliament.
But he answered, That he could not promise it. In the mean
time, the Hamiltons and the Earle of Lenox were agreed.<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a></p>

<p>At the day appointed, the Parliament was held at Edinburgh,
where the said Earle of Lenox was restored, after two
and twenty years exile: He was banished, and forfeited by
the Hamiltons, when they had the rule. There were some
Articles given in by the Church, especially for the abolishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
of the Masse universally, and for punishment of vice; but
there was little thing granted, save that it was Statute, That
scandalous livers should be punished first by prison, and then
publikely shewen unto the people with ignominy; but the
same was not put in execution.</p>

<p>In the end of this moneth of December, the Generall Assembly
of the Church was held at Edinburgh:<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> many things
were ordained for setling of the affairs of the Church.</p>

<p>In the end of January the Queen past to Fyfe,<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> and visiting
the Gentlemen's houses, was magnificently banquetted every
where, so that such superfluity was never seen before within
this Realme; which caused the wilde fowl to be so dear, that
partridges were sold for a crown a piece. At this time was
granted by an Act of Parliament, the confirmation of the feues
of Church Lands, at the desire of divers Lords, whereof the
Earle of Murray was chief. During the Queen's absence, the
Papists of Edinburgh went down to the Chappell to hear
Masse; and seeing there was no punishment, they waxed more
bold: some of them thinking thereby to please the Queen,
upon a certain Sunday in February, they made an Even-song of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
their own, setting two Priests on the one side of the quire,
and one or two on the other side, with Sandy Stevin, Menstrall,
(baptizing their children, and making marriages,) who, within
eight days after, convinced of blasphemy, alleadging, That he
would give no more credit to the New Testament than to a
tale of Robin Hood,<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> except it were confirmed by the Doctors
of the Church. The said superstitious Even-song was the occasion
of a great slander, for many were offended with it; which
being by the Brethren declared to the Lords of the Privy
Councell, especially to the Earle of Murray, who lamented the
cause to the Queen's Majestie, shewing her what inconveniency
should come if such things were suffered unpunished: And,
after sharp reasoning, it was promised, That the like should
not be done hereafter: The Queen also alleadged, That they
were a great number; and that she could not trouble their
conscience.</p>

<p>About the 20. of this moneth, arrived at Edinburgh, Henry
Stewart, Lord Darnley;<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> from thence he passed to Fyffe: And
in the place of Weemes he was admitted to kisse the Queen's
hand; whom she liked so well, that she preferred him before
all others, as shall hereafter, God willing, be declared. Soon
after, in the moneth of March, the Earle Bothwell arrived out
of France; whereat the Earle of Murray was highly offended,
because of the evil report made to him of the Lord Bothwell;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
and passing immediately to the Queen's Majestie, demanded of
her, If it was her will, or by her advice, that he was come home;
and seeing he was his deadly enemy, either he or the other
should leave the countrey, and therefore desired that he might
have justice. Her answer was, That seeing the Earle Bothwell
was a nobleman, and had done her service, she could not
hate him: Nevertheless she would do nothing that might be
prejudiciall to the Erle of Murray, but desired that the matter
might be taken away. Within few days she caused summon
the Earle Bothwell to answer to the course of law the 2d of
May, for the conspiracy which the Earle of Arrane had alledged
two years before, and for the breaking of the ward of the
Castle. In the meanwhile there was nothing in the Court but
banquetting, balling, and dancing, and other such pleasures as
were meet to provoke the disordered appetite; and all for the
entertainment of the Queen's cousin from England, the Lord
Darnley, to whom she did shew all the expressions imaginable
of love and kindenesse.<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a></p>

<p>Within few days, the Queen being at Sterlin, order was
given to Secretary Lethington to pass to the Queen of England.
The chief point of his message was, to declare to the Queen of
England, That the Queen was minded to marry her cousin the
Lord Darnley; and the rather, because he was so near of blood
to both Queens: for by his mother, he was cousin-german to
the Queen of Scotland, also of near kindred, and of the same
name by his father: His mother was cousin-german to the
Queen of England. Here mark God's providence: King James
the Fifth having lost his two sons, did declare his resolution
to make the Earle of Lenox his heir of the Crown; but he
prevented by sudden death, that design ceased. Then came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
the Earle of Lenox from France, with intention to marry
King James his widow; but that failed also: He marries Mary<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a>
Dowglas, and his son marrieth Mary, King James the Fifth his
daughter. And so the King's desire is fulfilled, to wit, The
Crown continueth in the name and in the family. The Queen
of England, nevertheless, shewed her self nothing pleased
therewith, but rather declared, That she would in no wise
suffer her subjects to make such contracts or alliance that
might be prejudiciall to her; and for the same purpose sent a
post to the Queen with letters, wherein she complained greatly
of the mind of our Mistris, seeing the great affection she bare
to her, intending to declare her heretrix of her Realme of
England, providing only that she would use her counsell in
marriage; but she could not approve her Marriage with the
Lord Darnley, although he was their near cousin by birth, since
he was below the rank of the Queen by condition, being but a
private subject. At the same time she wrote to the Earle of
Lenox, and to his son, commanding them to repair both into
England. Some write, That all this was but counterfeit by
the Queen of England, and from her heart she was glad of the
marriage, for by that means the Succession of the Crown of
England was secured, the Lord Darnley being the right
heir after the Queen of Scotland: and Queen Elizabeth
was not angry to see her married to one of inferior rank,
for by that means she thought the Scots Queen would be less
proud.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At this

<p>During this time there were certain letters directed to the
Brethren of Edinburgh, to Dundie, Fyfe, Angus, and Mernes,
and other places, from the Brethren of Kyle, and other places
in the West Countrey, desiring the professors of the Evangel
in all places, to remember what the Eternall God had wrought,
and how potently he had abolished all kind of idolatry and
superstition, and placed his word in this Realm, so that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
man could say otherwise but it was the work of God, who also
had delivered this countrey from the bondage and tyranny of
strangers: Nevertheless by our slothfulness, we have suffered
that idol the Masse not only to be planted again, but to increase
so, that the maintainers thereof are like, by all appearance,
to get the upper hand, which would be the occasion of
our destruction: And for that the Papists purposed to set up
their idol at Easter following, in all places, which was to be
imputed to the slothfulness and want of godly zeal of the professors.
Therefore they admonished the Brethren to strive to
avert the evil in time, and not to suffer such wickedness to
continue and encrease, lest God's heavy wrath come upon us
unawares like a consuming fire. By these letters many Brethren
were animated, and their spirits wakened, minding to provide
as God should give them grace. And first of all, by the
advice of the most learned in Edinburgh, there was a Supplication
made, and given to the Queen's Majestie by the
Superintendent of Lowthian, containing, in effect, That the
Church in generall of the Realme, had divers times most
humbly craved of her Majesty, That committers of adultery
should be punished according to the law of God and the Acts
of Parliament, nevertheless they continued in their wickednes;
and the Papists, of obstinate malice, pretended nothing else
but to erect and set up their idolatry and superstition; and
at Easter day following, they intended to put the
same in practice, which the Brethren and Professors of the
Evangel could not suffer; therefore wished her Majestie to
take heed of the matter.</p>

<p>This Supplication the Secretary received of the hands of the
Superintendents of Lowthian and Glasgow, and told them, in
the Queen's name, That there should be such provision made
as should serve to their contentment: And for the same purpose,
the Queen's Majestie writ to all such places as were suspected,
especially to the Bishop of Saint Andrewes and Aberdeine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
(as was said,) not to use any Masse, and that they
should not do any such thing as was feared by the Protestants,
or convene any Councell, and thereto commanded them. Now
the Communion was administred in Edinburgh, the 1st day of
April 1565: At which time, because it was near Easter, the
Papists used to meet at their Masse; and as some of the
Brethren were diligent to search such things, they having with
them one of the Bayliffs, took one Sir James Carvet, riding
hard, as he had now ended the saying of the Masse, and conveyed
him, together with the master of the house, and one or
two more of the assistants, to the Tolbuith, and immediately
revested him with all his garments upon him, and so carried
him to the Market-Crosse, where they set him on high, binding
the chalice in his hand, and himself fast tyed to the said
Crosse, where he tarried the space of one hour; during which
time the boyes served him with his Easter eggs. The next
day following, the said Carvet, with his assistants, were accused
and convinced by an assize, according to the Act of
Parliament: And albeit for the same offence he deserved
death, yet for all punishment, he was set upon the Market-Crosse
for the space of three or four hours, the hangman standing
by, and keeping him, the boyes and others were busie with
eggs casting; and some Papists there were that stopped as far
as they could: And as the presse of people encreased about
the Crosse, there appeared to have been some tumult. The
Provost, Archibald Dowglas, came with some Halberdiers, and
carried the Priest safe againe to the Tolbuith. The Queen
being advertised, and having received sinister information that
the Priest was dead, suddenly thought to have used and inflicted
some extreme punishment; for she thought that all this
was done in contempt of her, and of her Religion; and it was
affirmed, That the Towne should have been sacked, and a
great number executed to death: she sent to such as she
pleassed, commanding them to come to her at Edinburgh suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
with their whole forces; and in the mean time she sent
her Advocate, Master Spence of Condie, to Edinburgh, to take
a sure triall of the matter. The Provost and Councell wrote
to the Queen the truth of the matter as it was, desiring her
Majestie to take the same in good part, and not to give credit
to false reports, and therewith sent to her Majestie the processe
and enrolment of the Court of the Priest convict. Thus the
Queen's Majestie being informed of the truth by her said Advocate,
sent againe, and stayed the said meeting of men, and sent
to the Town a grave Letter, whereof the copie followeth:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">
<i>The Queen's Letter to the Provest, Bailiffe, and Councell<br />
of Edinburgh.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Provest</span>, Bayliffe, and Councell of our Citie of Edinburgh,
We received your letter from our Advocate, and understand by
this report what diligence you took to stay the tumult in the
late disorder attempted at Edinburgh; wherein, as you did
your duty in suppressing the tumult, so can We not take in
good part, nor think our self satisfied of so notorious a thing,
without certain seditious persons, who were pleased to do
justice perforce and without the Magistrates authoritie, be
condignly and really punished for their rashnesse and misbehaviour;
for if all private persons should usurpe to take vengeance
at their own hands, what lies in ours? And to what
purpose hath good laws and statutes been established? Since,
therefore, We have never been obstinate to the due punishment
of any offenders, prescribed by the lawes, but have alwayes
maintained justice in that case without respect of persons, it
is our will, and We command you, as you will answer to us
upon your obedience and allegiance, that you will take before
you certane of the most responsall persons which are declared
authors of the said sedition, and usurpers of our authority, and
to administer justice upon them, in such sort as We may know
a sinceritie on your parts, and our authority no wayes slighted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
But if you faile, perswade your selves, (and that shortly,) We
will not oversee it, but will account this contempt not only to
be in the committers thereof, but in yourselves, who ought to
punish it, and relieve us on our part, remitting the rest to
your diligence and execution, which We look for so soon as
reason will permit.</p>

<p class="signature">
"Subscribed with our hand at Sterlin, this 24. of April,<br />
Anno 1565."
</p></blockquote>

<p>By this manner of writing and high threatning, may be
perceived how grievously the Queen's Majestie would have
been offended if the said Tarbot<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> and Messe-monger had been
handled according to his demerite, being not only a Papist
idolater, but a manifest whoremaster, and a common fighter
and blasphemer; nevertheless, within few dayes the Queen
charged the Provest and Bailiffs to set him at libertie, commanding
them further, that no man should trouble nor molest
him in any sort for whatsoever cause, and soon after rewarded
him with a benefice, and likewise his assisters, John Low and
John Kennedie, set at libertie in the same manner. At this
Easter-tyde, in Sterlin, the Queen made her domestick servants
use Papisticall rites and ceremonies, and more, she perswaded
others by faire means to do the same, and threatned those that
were most constant at the Earle of Cassels house.</p>

<p>Upon the second day of May 1565, conveened at Edinburgh,
the Earl of Murray with his friends in great numbers, to keepe
the day of law against the Earle of Bothwell; who being called,
appeared not, only the Laird of Rickerton protested, That the
personall absence of the Earle Bothwell should not be prejudiciall
to him, by reason, that for just fear, which might happen in
the heart of any man, since he had so potent an enemy as the
Lord of Murray, who, next the Queen's Majesty, was of greatest
estimation and authority of any man within this Realm, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
whom assisted at this present day of law, seven or eight
hundred men, which force he could not resist, and therefore
had absented himself; which protestation being made, those
that had been sureties for his appearance, were outlawed.
The said Earle Bothwell, a few dayes after, past into France,
after he had been in Liddesdale, where, suspecting almost
every man, he was not in great assurance of his life, notwithstanding
he was not put to the horne; for the Queen continually
bore a great favour towards him, and kept him to be
a souldier, as appeared within lesse than half a year; for she
would not suffer the Lord Morton, nor my Lord Ariskin, my
Lord of Murray's great friends, to keep the day. There assisted
my Lord of Murray, the Earles of Argyle, Glenearne, and
Crawford, with great numbers, and many Lords and Barons,
who for the most part conveened the same afternoon to treat
and consult for the maintaining of Religion; where some
articles were devised, and delivered to the Lord of Murray to
be presented to the Queen's Majestie and Privie Councell;
which articles were enlarged at the Generall Assembly following,
as shall be declared.</p>

<p>In the meane time, as they were informed in Court of this
great Assembly of people in Edinburgh, they were affraid, for
naturally the Queen hated and suspected all such Conventions
as were not in her own presence, and devised by her self.
The chief Counsellors in the Court were the Earls of Lenox
and Athole. The Queen writ incontinent for all the Lords
to come to Sterlin, so soone as she was advertised that they
had treated in Edinburgh of Religion; she writ likewise for
the Superintendants and other learned men who went thither,
and being there, they caused to keep the ports or gates, and
make good watch about the towne. The speciall cause of
this Convention was to give to the Lord Darnley title of
honour, openly and solemnly, with consent of the Nobles,
before the marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>The fourth day of May the Earle of Murray came to Sterlin,
where he was well received by the Queen's Majestie, as appeared;
and immediately, as he past with her to my Lord
Darnley's chamber, they presented to him a contract, containing
in effect, That forasmuch, as, or since, the Queen had
contracted marriage with the Lord Darnley, and that therefore
sundry Lords of the Nobilitie had under-written, ratified,
and approved the same, and obliged themselves to grant unto
him in full Parliament the Crowne Matrimoniall, (by a new
Court solecisme in policie, the Crowne for the second time is
surnamed Matrimoniall; before, when the Queen was first married,
it was so called also,) to serve and obey him and her as
their lawfull Soveraignes. The Queen desired my Lord Murray
to subscribe, as many others had done before; which hee refused
to do, "Because, (said he,) it is required necessarily that
the whole Nobility be present, at least the principall, and such
as he himself was posteriour unto, before that so grave a matter
should be advised and concluded."</p>

<p>The Queen's Majesty no wayes content with this answer, insisted
still upon him, saying, The greatest part of the Nobilitie
were there present and content with the matter, wished him
to be so much a Stewart, as to consent to the keeping of the
Crown in the family, and the surname, according to their
Father's will and desire, as was said of him a little before his
death: But he still refused for the causes above written.</p>

<p>Now as the Lords were assembled, an Ambassadour from
England, named Sir Nicholas Throckmorton,<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> arrived at Sterlin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
and in his company the Laird of Lethington; the Ambassador
was at the Castle gate or ever they were aware; and as
he stood there in the entry, he was desired to passe to his
lodgings. The next day he had audience of the Queen, and
was graciously received according to the dignity of his message.
The whole summe of this his message was, to shew and
declare to the Queen, how highly the Queen his mistris was
offended with this precipitated marriage, and wondered what
had moved her to take a man of inferiour rank and condition
to her selfe: and therefore disswaded her therefrom. And
specially desiring her most earnestly to send home her subjects,
the Earle of Lennox and the Lord Darnley: but all in
vaine; for the matter was well farre proceeded. In her heart
Queen Elizabeth was not angry at this marriage; first, because
if Queen Mary had married a foraign Prince, it had been an
accesse to her greatnesse, and consequently she had been more
redoubted by the other; next, both Harry and Mary were
alike and in equall degree of consanguinitie unto her, the
father of Mary and the mother of Harry being children to her
Father's sister.</p>

<p>With many fair words the Queen let the Ambassadour depart,
promising to do all she could to satisfie the Queen of England;
and for the same purpose she would send an Ambassador to
her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Earl of
Murray
seeing the
other
Nobles consent
gave
his, which
before he
refused.</div>

<p>In the meane time the Queen's marriage with the Lord
Darnley was prepared and propounded in Councell, and the
chief of the Nobilitie, such as the Duke, the Earles of Argyle,
Murray, Glenearne, with the rest, granted freely to the same,
providing that they might have the Religion established in
Parliament, by the Queene, and the idolatrous Masse and
Superstition abolished; shortly it was concluded, that they
should convene again to Saint Johnstoun, where the Queen
promised to take a finall order for Religion. The day was
appointed, to wit, the last of May, at Perth: my Lord of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
Argile came too late. The Queen's Majestie communed with
the Lords, who were very plain with her, saying, Except the
Masse were abolished, there should be no quietnesse in the
countrey. The twelfth day of May the Lord Darnley was
belted, (that is, created) Earle of Rosse, with great solemnity,
a belt or girdle being tyed about his waist or middle; and
albeit all kinde of provision was made to make him Duke of
Rothesay, yet at that time it came not to effect, albeit the
crown and robe-royall were prepared to him for the same.
For the entertainment of this triumph there were many
Knights made, to the number of fourteen.<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> The next day,
which was the thirteenth of May, the Queen called for the
Superintendants, by name John Willock, John Winram, and
John Spotswood, whom she cherished with faire words, assuring
them, that she desired nothing more earnestly than the glory
of God, and satisfying of men's consciences, and the good of the
Commonwealth; and albeit she was not perswaded in any Religion
but in that wherein she was brought up, yet she promised
to them that she would hear conference and disputation
in the Scriptures: And likewise she would be content to hear
publike preaching, but alwayes out of the mouth of such as
pleased her Majestie; and above all others, she said, she would
gladly hear the Superintendant of Angus, (for he was a mild
and sweet natured man,) with true honesty and uprightnesse,
John Ariskin<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> of Dun.</p>

<p>Soon after the Queen past to Saint Johnston, after that she
had directed Master John Hay,<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> Prior of Monimusk, to passe
to England, who sped at the Queen of England's hand, even
as Sir Nicholas Throckmorton did in Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>Before the day which was appointed for the meeting at
Saint Johnston, my Lord of Murray, most carefull of the
maintenance of Religion, sent to all the principall Churches,
advertising them of the matter, and desiring them to advise,
and send the most able men in learning and reputation, to
keep the day; but their craft and dissimulation appeared, for
the Dean of Restalrigge who lately arrived out of France,<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> with
others, such as Mr. John Lesley, Parson of Oyne,<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> afterward
Bishop of Rosse, caused the Queen to understand that thing
whereof she was easily perswaded, to wit, That there ought to
be given to all men libertie of conscience, and for this purpose
to shun or put off the first day appointed. The Queen writ to
the Nobility, That because she was informed that there was
great meetings out of every shire and town in great number;
and then the other partie, (so termed she the Papists,) were
minded to gether to the said Convention, which should apparently
make trouble or sedition, rather than any other thing;
therefore she thought it expedient, and willed them to stay
the said meetings, and to deferre the same till such a day that
she should appoint with advice of her Councell. At this
time there was a Parliament proclaimed to be held at Edinburgh
the twentieth day of July. By this Letter, some of the
Protestants having best judgement, thought themselves sufficiently
warned of the inconveniences and troubles to come.
Now her Councell at this time was only the Earles of Lenox
and Athole, the Lord Ruthven, but chiefely David Rizio the
Italian ruled all; yet the Earle of Rosse<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> [was] already in
greatest credit and familiarity.</p>

<p>These Letters were sent out to the Lords about the eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
and twentieth day of May; and within twelve dayes thereafter,
she directed new missives to the chief of the Nobility,
desiring, or commanding them, to come to Saint Johnston the
three and twentieth day of June following, to consult upon
such things as concerned Religion, and other things, as her
Majesty should propose; Which day was even the day before
that the Generall Assembly should have been held in Edinburgh.
This last Letter uttered the effect of the former; so
that the Protestants thought themselves sufficiently warned.
Always as the Earle of Murray was passing to Saint Johnston
to have kept the said day, he chanced to fall sick of the
fluxes in Lochleven, where he remained till the Queen came
forth of Saint Johnston to Edinburgh, where the Generall Assembly
of the whole Church of Scotland was held the four and
twentieth day of July.<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> The Earles of Argyle and Glencarne
assisted the Church, with a great company of Lods, Barons,
and others: It was there ordered and concluded, That certain
Gentlemen, as Commissioners from the Church National,
should passe to the Queen's Majestie, with certain Articles,
to the number of six, desiring her most humbly to ratifie
and approve the same in Parliament.</p>

<p>And because the said <span class="smcap">Articles</span> are of great weight, and
worthy of memory, I thought good to insert the same word by
word.<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Imprimis</i>, That the Papisticall and blasphemous Masse, with
all Papisticall idolatry, and Papall jurisdiction, be universally
supprest and abolisht thorowout this Realme, not only in the
subjects, but also in the Queen's own person, with punishment
against all persons that should be deprehended to transgresse
and offend in the same: And that the sincere word of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
God, and Christ's true Religion, now at this present received,
be established, approved, and ratified, thorowout the whole
Realme, as well in the Queen's own person as in the subjects:
And that the people be [astricted] to resort upon the Sundays
at the least, to the prayers and preaching of God's word,
even as they were before to the idolatrous Masse: And these
Heads to be provided by Act of Parliament, and ratified by
the Queen's Majesty.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, That [sure] provision be made for sustentation of
the Ministry, as well for the time present, as the time to come:
And that such persons as are presently admitted to the Ministry,
may have their livings assigned unto them, in places
where they travell in their calling, or at least next adjacent
thereto: And that the Benefices now vacant, or hath been
vacant since the month of March 1558, or that hereafter shall
happen to be vacant, be disponed to qualified and learned persons,
able to preach God's Word, and discharge the vocation
concerning the Ministry, by tryall and admission of the Superintendents
and Overseers: And that no Benefice or Living,
having many Churches annexed thereunto, be disponed altogether
in any time to come, to any [one] man, but at the least
the Churches thereof be severally disponed, and that to severall
persons; so that every man having charge may serve at his
own church according to his vocation: And to that effect,
likewise the Gleebs and the Manses be given to the Ministers,
that they may make residency at their Churches, whereby
they may discharge their consciences according to their vocation;
and also, that the Kirks may be repaired accordingly;
and that a law be made and established hereupon by Act of
Parliament, as said is.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, That none be permitted to have charge of Souls,
[Schools,] Colledges, or Universities, neither privately or publickly
to teach and instruct the youth, but such as shall be
tried by the Superintendents or Visitors of churches, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
found sound and able in doctrine, and admitted by them to
their charges.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, For the Sustentation of the Poor, That all lands
founded for hospitality of old be restored again to the same
use; and that all lands, annual-rents, or any other emoluments,
pertaining any ways sometimes to the Friers, of whatsoever
Order they had been of; as likewise the annuities,
alterages, obits, and other duties pertaining to Priests, to be
applied to the sustentation of the poor, and uphold of the
town-schools in towns, and other places where they lie.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly</i>, That such horrible crimes as now abound within
this Realme, without any correction, to the great contempt of
God and his Word; such as Idolatry, blasphemie of God's
name, manifest breaking of the Sabbath-day, witchcraft, sorcery,
inchantment, adultery, manifest whoredome, maintenance
of bordals, murther, slaughter, oppression, with many
other detestable crimes, may be severely punished; and Judges
appointed in every province and diocesse, for execution thereof,
with power to do the same, and that by Act of Parliament.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, That some order be devised and established for ease
of the poor labourers of the ground, concerning the [un]reasonable
payment of the tythes, who are oppressed by the leasers
of the tythes set over their heads, without their own consent
and advice.</p></blockquote>

<p>The persons who were appointed by the Church to carry
these Articles, and present them to the Queen's Majestie, were
the Lairds of Cunninghamhead, Lundie, Spot, and Grange of
Angus, and James Baron for the Broughs:<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> These five past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
from Edinburgh to Saint Johnston, where they presented the
said Articles to the Queen's Majestie, desiring and requiring
her Highnesse most humbly to advise therewith, and to give
them answer. The next day, ere they were aware, the Queen
departed to Dunkeld, and immediately they followed; and
after they had gotten audience, they desired the Queen's Majestie
most humbly to give their dispatch. She answered,
That her Councell was not there present, but she intended to
be in Edinburgh within eight dayes, and there they should
receive their answer.</p>

<p>At the same time, as the Generall Assembly was holden
in Edinburgh, the Brethren perceiving the Papists to brag,
and trouble like to be, they assembled themselves at Saint
Leonard's Craig,<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> where they concluded they would defend
themselves; and for the same purpose, elected eight persons
of the most able, two of every quarter, to see that the Brethren
should be ready armed.</p>

<p>And when the five Commissioners above named had waited
upon the Court four or five days after her Majesties coming to
Edinburgh, there the matter was proposed in Councell: And
after long and earnest reasoning upon these Articles, at length
it was answered to the Commissioners by the Secretary, That
the Queen's Majesties command was, That the matter should
be reasoned in her presence; which for the gravitie of the
same, there could nothing be concluded at that time, albeit
the Queen's Majestie had heard more in that matter then ever
she did before: But within eight days thereafter, she understood
that a great part of the Nobilitie should be present in
Edinburgh, where they should have a final answer.</p>

<p>At length, the one and twentieth of August, they received
the answer in writing in her presence, according to the tenour
hereof, as followeth:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span><span class="smcap">The Queen's Majesties Answer to the Articles presented
to Her Highnesse, by certain Gentlemen, in the Name
of the whole Assemblie of the Church.</span></p>

<p>To the first, Desiring the Masse to be suppressed and abolished,
as well in the head as in the members, with punishment
against the contraveners; as also, the Religion professed
to be Established by Act of Parliament: It was answered
first, for her Majesties part, That her Highness is no way yet
perswaded in the said Religion, nor yet that any impiety is in
the Masse; and therefore believeth, that her loving subjects
will not press her to receive any Religion against her conscience,
which should be unto her a continuall trouble by remorse
of conscience, and therewith a perpetuall unquietness.
And to deal plainly with her subjects, her Majesty neither
will nor may leave the Religion wherein she hath been nourished
and brought up, and believeth the same to be well-grounded;
knowing, besides the grudge of conscience that she should
receive, upon the change of her own Religion, that she should
lose the friendship of the King of France, the married Allia
of this Realme, and of other great Princes her friends and
confederates, who would take the same in evil part, and of
whom she may look for their great support in all her necessities.
And having no assured consideration that may countervail
the same, she will be loth to put in hazard all her friends
at an instant; praying all her loving subjects, seeing they have
had experience of her goodness, that she hath neither in times
past, not yet intends hereafter, to press the conscience of any
[man,] but that they may worship God in such sort, as they
are preswaded in their conscience to be best, that they will
also not presse her conscience.</p>

<p>As to the establishing of Religion in the body of the
Realme, they themselves know, as appears by their Articles,
that the same cannot be done only by consent of her Majestie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
but requires necessarily the consent of the [three] States in
Parliament; and therefore so soon as the Parliament holds,
those things which the [three] States agree upon amongst
themselves, her Majestie shall consent unto the same; and in
the mean time shall make sure, that no man be troubled for
using [themselves in] religion according to conscience; so that
no man shall have cause to doubt, that for religion's sake men's
lives and heritage shall be in any hazard.</p>

<p>To the second Article, it is answered, That her Majestie
thinks it no wayes reasonable, that she should defraud her self
of so great a part of the patrimony of the Crowne, as to put
the Patronage of Benefices forth of her own hands; for her
owne necessity in bearing of her port and common charges
will require the retention thereof, and that in a good part, in
her owne hands: Neverthelesse her Majestie is well pleased,
that consideration being bad of her owne necessity, and what
may be sufficient for [her, and for] the reasonable sustentation
of the Ministers, a speciall assignation he made to them in
places most commodious and meet: with which her Majesty
shall not meddle, but suffer the same to come to them.</p>

<p>To the third Article, it is answered, That her Majestie
shall do therein as shall be agreed by the States in Parliament.</p>

<p>To the fourth Article, Her Majesties liberality towards the
poore shall alwayes be so far extended, as can be reasonably
required at her hands.</p>

<p>To the fifth and sixth Articles, Her Majesty will refer the
taking order therein unto the States assembled in Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span></p>
<p>As the Queen's Majestie came from Saint Johnston, over
Forth to the Callender, she was conveyed to the water side of
Forth with two hundred spears: For at that time it was
bruted, that there was some lying in wait at the Path of Dron.<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a>
In the mean time the Earle of Murray was in Lochlevin, and
the Earle of Argyle with him. Now in the Callender<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> the
Lord Levingston had desired the Queen's Majestie to be witnesse
to the christning of a child; for his Lady was lately delivered
and brought to bed: And when the Minister made the
sermon and exhortation concerning baptisme, the Queen's
Majestie came in the end, and said to the Lord Levingston,
"That she would shew him that favour that she had not
done to any other before;" that is, that she would give her
presence to the Protestant sermon, which was reckoned a
great matter.</p>

<p>The Queen being in the Callender, was informed both by
word and letters by false brethren, That a great part of the
Protestants of Edinburgh had lately convened upon Saint
Leonard's Craigs, and there made a conspiration against her;
and had chosen for the same purpose certain Captains to
governe the rest: And without any tryall, or perfect notice
taken in the case, she sent to the Provest and Bayliffs of
Edinburgh, commanding them to take and apprehend Alexander
Guthrie, Alexander Clerke, Gilbert Lawder, and Andrew
Sclater, and put them in prison in the Castle.<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a></p>

<p>This new and unaccustomed fashion of proceeding seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
be very strange: And because the said four persons were not
apprehended, she sent the next day a charge to the Provest
and Bayliffs, and to her owne great Treasurer, to passe to the
houses of the said foure men, and likewise to their booths or
shops, and there to take inventory of all their goods and
chattells; and commanded the said Treasurer to take the
keyes of the said houses and booths, together with the said
inventory; which was executed in effect, especially upon the
said Alexander Guthrie his wife, he being then common Clerke,
and one of the greatest in estimation within the towne: his
wife and children were shut out of their house, and compelled
to seek some other lodging in the town.</p>

<p>By this manner of proceeding, the hearts of all men of spirit
and judgement were wonderfully abashed and wounded, seeing
and perceiving these things so furiously handled upon sinister
and wrong information, men never called to their answer, nor
heard, nor any triall taken therein. Immediately thereafter,
as she came to Edinburgh, she called to counsell such as
pleased her Majestie, and there complains of the said matter,
alleadging it to be a conspiracy and manifest treason. And
another matter likewise was complained upon, that the Earle
of Argile (as the Queen was surely informed,) was riding with
a great army to invade the Earle of Athole and his lands.
For the first matter it was concluded by the Councell, that
diligent inquisition should be made in the matter, and to that
purpose appointed the Queen's Advocates, Master John Spence of
Condie,<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> and Master Robert Crichton, to examine such as they
would; and when the said Advocates had called before them,
and examined a sufficient number, and their depositions subscribed
and delivered to the Queen, there was nothing found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
worthy of death nor treason: At length the said four persons
were summoned to answer at law.</p>

<p>For the [other] matter, That the Queen's Majestie should
send to the Earles of Argyle and Athole some of her Councell
or familiar servants to take order touching it.<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> And when the
Secretary, the Justice Clarke, and Lord of Saint Colme<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> had
past to the said Earl of Argyle, they found no such thing; but
in Athole there was great fear come of a sudden fray; for
after many proclamations, the Fire-crosse (which they made
use of in lieu of beacons) was raised in Athole.</p>

<p>Now as the day of Parliament approached, the Lords pretending
to consult before what should be done, as well in
Religion, as for the Commonwealth, the fifteenth day of July
there convened at Sterlin the Duke, the Earles of Argyle, and
Murray, Rothes, and other Lords and Barons; and as they
were devising and consulting, the Queen's Majesty taking their
meeting in evill part, sent her Advocates, Master John Spence
and Master [Robert] Crichton, to them at Sterlin, requiring the
cause of their meeting. They answered, That the speciall
occasion of their meeting was for the cause of Religion and
the assurance thereof, according as they had lately written to
the Queen's Majesty in Seaton from the town of Edinburgh,
they desiring then to prorogate the day.</p>

<p>Finally, when the said Advocates could by no means perswade
them to come to Edinburgh, they returned again to
Edinburgh, and declared to the Queen's Majestie according as
they had found.</p>

<p>In the mean time the Parliament was prorogated at the
Queen's Majesties command to the first of September next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
after following; for it was thought, that the least part and
principall of the chief Nobility being absent, there could no
Parliament be holden: at the same time the Queen's Majestie
perceiving that the matter was already come to a maturity
and ripenesse, so that the minds and secrecy of men's hearts
must needs be disclosed, she wrote to a great number of Lords,
Barons, Gentlemen, and others that were nearest in Fife,
Angus, Lowthian, Mers, Tevidale, Perth, Lithgow, Clidsdall,
and others to resort to her, in this form of words hereafter following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">
<i>The Queen's Letter.</i>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Trusty friend</span>, We greet you well: We are grieved indeed

have molested any man in the using of his Religion and

yet since we perceive the too easie beleeving such reports hath

carefull for the safety and preservation of our State; wherefore
we pray you most affectionately, that with all possible haste,

friends, and whole force, well furnished with armes for warre,
be provided for, fifteen dayes after your coming, addresse you
to come to us, to write and attend upon us, according to our
expectation and trust in you, as you will thereby declare the
good affection you bear to the maintenance of our authoritie,
and will do us therein acceptable service.</p>

day of July, 1565."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>There was likewise Proclamation made in Edinburgh, That
the Queen minded not to trouble nor alter the Religion;
and also Proclamations made in the Shires above mentioned,
for the same purpose, That all freeholders and other gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
should resort, (in the aforesaid manner,) to Edinburgh,
where the Earl of Rosse was made Duke of Rothesay, with
great triumph, the 23rd day of July. The same afternoon the
Queen complained grievously upon the Earl of Murray, in
open audience of all the Lords and Barons; and the same day
the bans of the Earl of Rosse and Duke of Rothesay and
the Queen's marriage were proclaimed. About this time the
Lord Arskin was made Earl of Marre. In the mean time
there were divers messages sent from the Queen's Majestie to
the Lord of Murray, first, Master Robert Crichton, to perswade
him by all means possible to come and resort to the
Queen's Majestie: His answer was, That he would be glad to
come to her self, according to his bounden duty; yet for as
much as such persons as were most privie in her company
were his capitall enemies, who also had conspired his death,
he could no wayes come so long as they were in Court.</p>

<p>Soon after my Lord Erskin, and the Master Maxwell, past
to him to St. Andrews, rather suffered and permitted by the
Queen, then sent by her Highness; after them the Laird of
Dun, who was sent by the means of the Earl of Mar; but all
this did not prevail with him; and when all hope of his coming
was past, an herald was sent to him, charging him to come to
the Queen's Majesty, and answer to such things as should be
laid to his charge, within eight and fourty hours next after the
charge, under pain of rebellion; and because he appeared not
the next day after the eight and fourty hours, he was denounced
rebell, and put to the horne. The same order they
used against the Earl of Argyle; for the Queen said she would
serve him and the rest with the same measure they had mete
to others, meaning the said Argyle.</p>

<p>In the mean while, as the fire was well kindled and enflamed,
all means and ways were sought to stir up enemies
against the chief Protestants that had been lately at Sterlin;
for the Earl of Athole was ready bent against the Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
Argyle: the Lord Lindesay against the Earl Rothesse in Fyfe,
they both being Protestants; for they had contended now a
long time for the heir ship of Fyfe: And that no such thing
should be left undone, the Lord Gordon,<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> who now had remained
neer three yeers in prison in Dumbar, was, after some
little travell of his friends, received by the Queen; and being
thus received into favour, was restored first to the Lordship of
Gordon, and soon after to the Erldom of Huntley, and to all
his lands, honours, and dignities, that he might be a bar and
a party in the North to the Earl of Murray.</p>

<p>The 28. of July,<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> late in the evening, neer an hour after the
sun's going down, there was a Proclamation made at the
Market-Cross of Edinburgh, containing in effect:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">That</span> forasmuch as at the will and pleasure of Almighty
God, the Queen had taken to her husband a right excellent
illustrious Prince, Harry Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Rosse,
Lord Darnley, Therefore it was her will, that he should be
holden and obeyed, and reverenced as King: Commanding all
letters and proclamations to be made in the names of Henry
and Mary in times coming."</p>

<p>The next day following, at six hours in the morning, they
were married<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> in the Chappell Royall of Halyrud-House, by
the Dean of Restalrig; the Queen being all clothed in mourning:
But immediately, as the Queen went to Masse, the King
not with her, but to his pastime. During the space of
three or four days, there was nothing but balling, and dancing,
and banquetting.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">of Halyrudhous, at sex houris</span><br />
in the mornyng, be Mr. Johne Sinclare,
Deane of Restalrig, wilh greit magnificence,

of this Realme." (Diurnal of Occurrents,
p. 80.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>In the mean time, the Earl Rothesse, the Laird of Grange,
the Tutor of Pitcur, with some gentlemen of Fyfe, were put to
the horne, for non-appearance; and immediately the swash,
tabron, and drums were stricken or beaten, for men of war to
serve the King and Queen's Majestie, and to take their pay.
This sudden alteration and hasty creation of Kings, moved the
hearts of a great number.</p>

<p>Now, amongst the people there were divers bruits; for some
alleadged, That the cause of this alteration was not for Religion,
but rather for hatred, envie of sudden promotion or dignity,
or such worldly causes: But they that considered the
progress of the matter, according as is heretofore declared,
thought the principall cause to be only for Religion.</p>

<p>In this mean time, the Lords past to Argyle, taking, apparently,
little care of the trouble that was to come: Howbeit
they sent into England Master Nicolas Elphinston for support,
who brought some moneys in this countrey, to the sum of
ten thousand pounds sterlin. There came one forth of England
to the Queen, who got presence the seventh of August in
Halyrud-House. He was not well, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Note this
for our
time.</div>

<p>About the fifteenth of August, the Lords met at Aire, to
wit, the Duke of Hamilton, the Earls Argyle, Murray, Glencarne,
Rothesse, the Lord Boyd and Ochiltrie, with divers
Barons and Gentlemen of Fyfe and Kyle, where they concluded
to be in readiness with their whole forces the four and
twentieth day of August. But the King and Queen with great
celerity prevented them; for their Majesties sent thorow Lowthian,
Fife, Angus, Strathern, Tividaile, and Cliddisdaile, and
other shires, making their Proclamations in this manner,
"That forasmuch as certain Rebels, who, (under colour of Religion,)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
intended nothing but the trouble and subversion of the
Commonwealth, were to convene with such as they might perswade
to assist them; therefore they charged all manner of
men, under pain of life, lands, and goods, to resort and meet
their Majesties at Linlithgow, the 24. day of August."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The King,
to make
himself
more popular,
and to
take from
the Lords
of the Congregation
the pretext
of Religion,
he went to
the Kirk to
hear John
Knox
preach.</div>

<p>This Proclamation was made in Lowthian the third day of
the said month. Upon Sunday, the nineteenth of August,<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a>
the King came to the High Kirk of Edinburgh, where John
Knox made the Sermon: his text was taken out of the six
and twentieth chapter of Esayas his Prophesie, about the
thirteenth verse, where, in the words of the Prophet, he said,
"O Lord our God, other lords then thou have ruled over us."
Whereupon he took occasion to speak of the government of
wicked Princes, who, for the sins of the people, are sent as
tyrants and scourges to plague them: And amongst other
things, he said, "That God sets in that room, (for the offences
and ingratitude of the people,) boys and women." And some
other words which appeared bitter in the King's ears, as, "That
God justly punished Ahab and his posterity, because he would
not take order with that harlot Jezabel." And because he had
tarried an hour and more longer than the time appointed,
the King, (sitting in a throne made for that purpose,) was
so moved at this Sermon, that he would not dine; and
being troubled, with great fury he past in the afternoon to
the hawking.</p>

<p>Immediately John Knox was commanded to come to the
Councell, where, in the Secretaries chamber, were convened
the Earl of Athole, the Lord Ruthven, the Secretary, the
Justice Clark, with the Advocate. There passed along with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
the Minister a great number of the most apparent men of the
Towne. When he was called, the Secretary declared, "That the
King's Majestie was offended with some words spoken in the
Sermon, (especially such as are above rehearsed,) desiring him
to abstain from preaching for fifteen or twenty days, and let
Master Craig supply the place."</p>

<div class="sidenote">In answering
he said
more than
he had
preached,
for he
added,
That as the
King had
(to pleasure
the
Queen)
gone to
Masse, and
dishonoured
the Lord
God, so
should God
in his justice
make
her an instrument
of
his ruin;
and so it
fell out in a
very short
time; but
the Queen
being
incensed
with these
words, fell
out in
tears, and
to please
her, John
Knox must
abstain
from
preaching
for a time.</div>

<p>He answered, "That he had spoken nothing but according
to his text; and if the Church would command him either to
speak or abstain, he would obey, so far as the Word of God
would permit him."</p>

<p>Within four days after, the King and Queen sent to the
Councell of Edinburgh, commanding them to depose Archibald
Douglas,<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> and to receive the Laird [of] Craigmiller for their
Provest, which was presently obeyed.</p>

<p>The five and twentieth of August, the King and Queen's
Majesties past from Edinburgh to Linlithgow, and from thence
to Sterlin, and from Sterlin to Glasgow. At their [first] arrival
their whole people were not come. The next day after
their arrivall to Glasgow, the Lords came to Paisley, where they
remained that night, being in company about one thousand
horses. On the morrow they came to Hamilton, keeping the
high passage from Paisley hard by Glasgow, where the King
and Queen easily might behold them. The night following,
which was the penult of August, they remained in Hamilton
with their company; but for divers respects moving
them, they thought it not expedient to tarry; especially,
because the Earl of Argyle was not come: for his diet was
not afore the second of September following, to have been at
Hamilton.</p>

<p>Finally, They took purpose to come to Edinburgh, the which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
they did the next day.<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> And albeit Alexander Areskin,<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> Captain
under the Lord his brother, caused to shoot forth of the
Castle two shot of cannon, they being near the town; and likewise
that the Laird [of] Craigmiller, Provest, did his endeavour
to hold the Lords forth of the town, in causing the common bells
to be rung, for the convening of the town to the effect aforesaid;
yet they entred easily at the West-Port or Gate, without
any molestation or impediment, being in number, as they esteemed
themselves, one thousand three hundred horses. Immediately
they dispatched messengers southward and northward
to assist them; but all in vain: And immediately after
they were in their lodgings, they caused to strike or beat the
drum, desiring all such men as would receive wages for the
defence of the glory of God, that they should resort the day
following to the Church, where they should receive good pay:
But they profited little that way; neither could they in Edinburgh
get any comfort or support, for none or few resorted
unto them; yet, they got more rest and sleep when they were
at Edinburgh then they had done in five or six nights before.</p>

<p>The Noblemen of this company were, the Duke, the Earls
Murray, Glencarne, and Rothesse; the Lords Boyd and Uchiltrie;
the Lairds of Grange, Cunninghamhead, Balcomie, and
Lawers; the Tutor of Pitcur; the Lairds of Barr, Carnell,<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> and
Dreghorn; and the Laird of Pittarow, Comptroller, went with
them. Some said merrily, That they were come to keep the
Parliament; for the Parliament was continued till the first day
of September: Upon the which day they wrote to the King
and Queen's Majesties a letter, containing in effect, That albeit
they were persecuted most unjustly, which they understood
proceeded not of the King and Queen's Majesties own
nature, but only by evil counsell, yet notwithstanding they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
were willing and content to suffer according to the laws of the
Realme, providing that the true Religion of God might be established,
and the dependants thereupon be likewise reformed:
beseeching their Majesties most humbly to grant these things;
but otherwise, if their enemies would seek their blood, they
should understand it should be dear bought. They had
written twice, almost to the same effect, to the King and
Queen's Majesties, after their passing from Edinburgh; for the
Laird of Preston presented a letter to the King and Queen's
Majestie, and was therefore imprisoned, but soon after released;
nevertheless they got no answer.</p>

<p>The same day that they departed out of Hamilton, the King
and Queen's Majesties issued out of Glasgow in the morning
betimes, and passing towards Hamilton, the army met their
Majesties near the Bridge of Cadder. As they mustered, the
Master of Maxwell sat down upon his knees, and made a long
oration to the Queen, declaring what pleasure she had done to
them, and ever laid the whole burden upon the Earl Murray.
Soon after, they marched forward in battell array: The Earl
of Lenox took the vanguard, the Earl of Mortoun the middle
battell, and the King and Queen the rear: The whole number
were about five thousand men, whereof the greatest part
were in the vanguard.</p>

<p>As the King and Queen's Majesties were within three miles
of Hamilton, they were advertised that the Lords were departed
in the morning; but where they pretended to be that
night, it was uncertain. Always, soon after their return to
Glasgow, the King and Queen were certainly advertised that
they were past to Edinburgh; and therefore caused immediately
to warn the whole army to pass with them to Edinburgh
the next day, who, early in the morning, long before the
sun was risen, began to march: But there arose such a vehement
tempest of wind and rain from the west, as the like had
not been seen before in a long time; so that a little brook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
turned incontinent into a great river; and the raging storm
being in their face,<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> with great difficulty went they forward:
And albeit the most part waxed weary, yet the Queen's
courage encreased man-like so much, that she was ever with
the foremost. There was divers persons drowned that day in
the water of Carron; and amongst others, the King's master,
a notable Papist, who, for the zeal he bare to the Masse, carried
about his neck a round god of bread, well closed in a case,
which always could not serve [save] him.</p>

<p>Before the end of August, there came a post to the Queen's
Majestie, sent by Alexander Areskin, who declared, That the
Lords were in the town of Edinburgh, where there was a multitude
of innocent persons, and therefore desired to know if he
should shoot. She commanded incontinent, that he should return
again to the said Alexander, and command him, in her
name, That he should shoot so long as he had either powder
or bullet, and not spare for any body.</p>

<p>At night, the King and Queen came well wet to the Callender,
where they remained that night. And about eight hours
at night, the first of September, the post came again to the
Castle, and reported the Queen's command to Alexander Areskin,
who incontinently caused to shoot six or seven shot of
cannon, whereof the marks appeared, having respect to no
reason, but only to the Queen's command.</p>

<p>The Lords perceiving that they could get no support in
Edinburgh, nor souldiers for money, albeit they had travelled
all that they could; and being advertised of the Queen's returning
with her whole company, they took purpose to depart.
And so the next day betimes, long before day, they departed
with their whole company, and came to Laurik,<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
thence to Hamilton, where the Master of Maxwell came to
them, with his uncle, the Laird of Dumlanrick. And after
consultation, the said Master wrote to the Queen's Majestie,
that being required by the Lords as he was passing homeward,
he could not refuse to come to them; and after that he had
given them counsell to disperse their army, they thought it
expedient to pass to Dumfreis to repose them, where they
would consult and make their offers,<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> and send to their Majesties;
and thus beseeching their Majesties to take this in
good part. The town of Edinburgh sent two of the Councell
of the town to make their excuse.</p>

<p>The next day the King and Queen past to Sterlin, and sent
to Edinburgh, and caused a Proclamation to be made, commanding
all men to return to Glasgow, where, having remained
three or four days, and understanding that the Lords were past
to Dumfries, they returned to Sterlin, and from thence to Fyfe;
and in their passage, caused to take in Castle Campbell, which
was delivered without impediment to the Lord of Sanquhar.</p>

<p>Before the King and Queen went out of Sterlin, there
came from Edinburgh two ensignes of footmen, to convey
them into Fyfe. In the meantime, the Burroughs were taxed
in great sums unaccustomed, for the payment of the souldiers:
Farther, there was raised divers troops of horsemen, to the
number of five or six hundred horse. The souldiers had taken
two poor men that had received the Lords wages; which two
men being accused and convinced of, at the Queen's command,
were hanged at Edinburgh, the third day after the Lords departing.
At this time, Master James Balfour, Parson of
Flesk,<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> had gotten all the guiding in the Court.</p>

<p>The third day after the Queen's coming to Fyfe, the whole
Barons and Lairds of Fyfe convoyed her Majestie, till she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
came to Saint Andrews, where the said Lairds and Barons,
especially the Protestants, were commanded to subscribe to
a Band, containing in effect, That they obliged themselves to
defend the King and Queen's persons, against Englishmen and
rebells: and in case they should come to Fyfe, they should
resist them to their utmost power; which charge every man
obeyed.</p>

<p>The second night after the Queen's coming to Saint Andrews,
she sent a band, or troop of horsemen, and another of
foot, to Lundie, and at midnight took out the Laird, being a
man of eighty years old; then they past to Fawside, and
took likewise Thomas Scot, and brought him to Saint Andrews;
where they, with the Laird of Bavard,<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> and some others, were
commanded to prison. This manner of handling and usage
being onkend and strange, were heavily spoken of, and a great
terrour to others, who thought themselves warned of greater
severity to come.</p>

<p>In the meantime the houses of the Earls of Murray, Rothesse,
and the houses of divers gentlemen, were given in
keeping to such as the Queen pleased, after that their children
and servants had been cast out.</p>

<p>At the same time the Duke, the Earls of Glencairn and
Argyle, the Lords Boyd and Uchiltrie, with the Laird of Cunninghamhead,
and the rest, were charged to come and present
themselves in Saint Andrews, before the King and Queen's
Majesties, to answer to such things as should be laid to their
charge, within six days, under the pain of rebellion: And the
day being expired, and they not appearing, were denounced
rebells, and put to the horn.</p>

<p>As the Queen remained in Saint Andrews, the inhabitants
of Dundie, being sore afraid, because of some evil report made
of them to the Queen, as if they had troubled the Queen, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
seeking men of war, and suffered some to be raised in their
town for the Lords; for there was nothing done in Dundie,
but it was revealed to the Queen; especially that the Minister<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a>
had received a letter from the Lords, and delivered the same
to the Brethren, perswading them to assist the Lords; which
being granted by the Minister, the Queen remitted it [for trial.]
After great travell and supplication made by some Noblemen,
at length, the King and Queen being in the town, they agreed
for two thousand marks, five or six of the principall left out,
with some others, that were put to their shift. After the King
and Queen had remained two nights in the town of Dundie,
they came to Saint Andrews;<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> and soon after they came over
Forth, and so to Edinburgh. During this time the Master of
Maxwell wrote to the King and Queen, making offers for, and
in the name of the Lords.</p>

<p>The next day after the King and Queen's coming to Edinburgh,
there was a Proclamation made at the Market Cross:
And because the same is very notable, I thought good to insert
it here word by word, albeit it be somewhat long.</p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">"<span class="smcap">Henry</span> and <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, by the Grace of God, King and Queen
of Scots; To all and sundry, our Lieges and Subjects
whom it may concern, and to whose knowledge these
letters shall come, greeting.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">
Note how
this agrees
with our
times.</div>

<div class="sidenote">
Let this be
conferred
with our
times.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Note diligently.</div>

<blockquote><p>"Forasmuch as in this uproar lately raised up against us,
by certain rebels and their assistants, the authors thereof,
(to blind the eyes of the simple people,) have given them
to understand, that the quarrell they have in hand is only
Religion, thinking with that cloke to cover their ungodly
designs, and so, under that plausible argument, to draw after
them a large train of ignorant persons, easy to be seduced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
Now, for the preservation of our good subjects, whose case
were to be pitied, if they blindly should suffer themselves to
be induced and trapped in so dangerous a snare, it hath
pleased the goodness of God, by the utterance of their own
mouths and writings to us, to discover the poison that before
lay hid in their hearts, albeit to all persons of clear judgment
the same was evident enough before: For what other thing<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a>
might move the principal raisers of this tumult to put themselves
in arms against us so unnaturally, upon whom We
had bestowed so many benefits; but that the great honour
We did them, they being thereof unworthy, made them misknow
themselves; and their ambition could not be satisfied
with heaping riches upon riches, and honour upon honour,
unless they retain in their hands us and our whole Realme,
to be led, used, and disposed at their pleasure. But this
could not the multitude have perceived, if God, (for disclosing
their hypocrisy,) had not compelled them to utter their
unreasonable desire to govern; for now by letters, sent from
themselves to us, which make plain profession, that the establishing
of Religion will not content them, but We must be
forced to govern by Councell, such as it shall please them to
appoint us; a thing so farre beyond all measure, that We think
the only mention of so unreasonable a demand is sufficient to
make their nearest kinsfolks their most mortall enemies, and
all men to run on them without further scruple, that are
zealous to have their native country to remain still in the state
of a kingdom: For what other thing is this, but to dissolve
the whole policie; and, (in a manner,) to invert the very order
of nature, to make the Prince obey, and subjects command.
The like was never demanded by [of] any of our most noble progenitors
heretofore, yea, not of Governors and Regents; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
Prince, and such as have filled their place, chose their Councell
of such as they thought most fit for the purpose. When We
ourselves were of less age, and at our first returning into this
our Realme, We had free choice of our Councell at our pleasure,
and now when We are at our full maturity, shall We be brought
back to the state of pupills, and be put under tutory? So long
as some of them bore the whole sway with us, this matter was
never called in question; but now when they cannot be longer
permitted to do and undoe all at their pleasure, they will
put a bridle into our mouthes, and give us a Councell chosen
after their fantasie. This is the quarrell of Religion they made
you beleeve they had in hand: This is the quarrell for which
they would have you hazard your lands, lives, and goods, in
the company of a certain number of rebels against your naturall
Prince. To speak in good language, they would be Kings
themselves, or at the least leaving to us the bare name and
title, and take to themselves the credit and whole administration
of the kingdome.</p>

<p>"We have thought good to make publication hereof, to shew,
that you suffer not yourselves to be deceived under pretence of
Religion, to follow them, who prefering their particular advancement
to the publike tranquilitie, and having no care of
you, in respect of themselves, would (if you would hearken to
their voice) draw you after them, to your utter destruction.
Assuring you, that you have heretofore good experience of our
clemency, and under our wings enjoyed in peace the possession
of your goods, and lived at liberty of your conscience, so may
you be in full assurance of the like hereafter, and have us
alwayes your good and loving Princes, to so many as shall continue
your selves in due obedience, and do the office of faithfull
and naturall subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>Now, the Lords desired, next the establishing of Religion,
that the Queens Majesty, in all the affairs of the Realme and
Commonwealth, should use the counsell and advice of the
Nobility, and ancient blood of the same; whereas in the mean
time the councell of David, and Francisco, the Italians,<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> with
Fowler the Englishman, and Master James Balfour, parson of
Flisk, was preferred before all others, save only the Earle of
Athole, who was thought to be a man of grosse jugement, but
neverthelesse in all things given to please the Queen. It was
now finally come to this point, that instead of law, justice, and
equity, only will ruled in all things.</p>

<p>There was thorow all the countrie set out a Proclamation in
the King and Queen's names, commanding all persons to come
and meet them at Sterlin, the first day of October following,
with twenty dayes provision, under pain of life, lands, and
goods. It was uncertain whether their Majesties intended to
passe from Sterlin or not, and I beleeve the principall men
knew not well at that time; for a report was, that by reason
the Castles of Hamilton and Draffen were kept fortified and
victualled at the Duke's command, that they would passe to
siege the said houses, and give them some shot of a canon:
others said, they would passe towards my Lord of Argile, who
had his people alwayes armed, whereof his neighbours were
afraid, especially the inhabitants of Athole and Lenox; but at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
length it was concluded that they should passe to Dumfries,
as shall be declared.</p>

<p>During this time there were propositions made continually
to the King and Queen by the Lords, desiring alwayes their
Majesties most humbly to receive them into their hands.
Their Articles tended continually to these two heads, viz., To
abolish the Masse, root out Idolatry, and establish the true
Religion: And that they and the affaires of the Realm should
be governed by the advice and counsell of the true Nobility of
the same; offering themselves, and their cause, to be tried by
the lawes of the countrey. Yet nothing could be accepted nor
taken in good part, albeit the Master of Maxwell laboured by
all means to redresse the matter, who also entertained the
Lords most honourably in Dumfreis, for he had the goverment
of all that country. But he himself incurred the Queen's
wrath so, that he was summoned to present himself, and appear
before the King and Queens Majesties, after the same form
that the rest of the Lords were charged with; and also commanded
to give over the house of Lochmaben, and the Castle,
which he had in keeping for the Queen. And albeit he obeyed
not, yet was he not put to the horn, as the rest. Nevertheless
there was no man that doubted of his good will and partaking
with the Lords, who in the mean time sent Robert
Melvin to the Queen of England, and declared their state to
her Majesty, desiring support.</p>

<p>Now, the chief care and solicitude that was in the Court,
was, by what means they might come to have money; for notwithstanding
this great preparation for war, and eminent
appearance of trouble, yet were they destitute of the sinewes
of war:<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> Albeit the Treasurer, and now Comptroller,<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> to wit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
the Laird of Tillibardin, had disbursed many thousands; yet
there was no appearance of payment of souldiers, nor scarcely
how the King and Queen's houses and pompous trains should
be upholden:<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a> there was about 600 horsemen, besides the
guard and three ensignes of footmen. The charge of the
whole would amount to £1000 sterling, every month; a thing
surpassing the usuall manner of Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">So was the
Citie of
London,
for warre
against
Scotland,
vexed for
the leavie
money.</div>

<p>At this time arrived the Earl of Bothwell,<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> who was welcome,
and graciously received by the Queen, and immediately placed
in Councell, and made Lieutenant of the West and Middle
Marches. Now as every one of the Burrows<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> compounded to be
exempted from this meeting; the Earl of Athole demanded of
Edinburgh £200 sterling, but they refused to pay it; notwithstanding,
October 27th, there was a certain number of the
principall and rich persons of the town warned by a Macer to
pass to the Palace of Hallyrudhouse to the King and Queen,
who declared to them by their own mouth's speaking that they
had use for money, and therefore knowing them to be honest
men, and the inhabitants of the best citie in their countrey,
they must needs charge them; and for security they should
have other men bound for pledges, or any hand therefore.
The sum that they desired was £1000 sterling, and no less.
They being astonished, made no answer; but Parson Flisk
standing by, said, that seeing the King and Queens Majesties
desired them so civilly, in a thing most lawfull in their necessitie,
they did shew themselves not honest to keep silence and
give no answer to their Majesties, for that must needs be had
of them which was required; and if they would not, they
should be constrained by the laws, which they would not abide;
for some of them had deserved hanging, (said he,) because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
had lent large sums of money to the King and Queen's enemies
and rebels; and therefore, they must shortly suffer great
punishment.</p>

<p>Soon after they were called in one by one, and demanded
how much they would lend? Some made this excuse, and
some that, by reason there were that offered to lend money;
amongst whom there was one offered to lend £20. To him
the Earle of Athole said, thou art worthy to be hanged that
speakest of £20, seeing the Princes charge thee so easily.
Finally, they were all imprisoned, and souldiers set over them,
having their muskets ready charged, and their match lighted,
even in the house with them, where they remained all that
night, and the next day till night; and then being changed
from one prison to another, there were six chosen out and sent
in the night to the Castle of Edinburgh, convoyed with musketteers
round about them, as if they had been murtherers or
most vile persons. At length, (the third day,<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a>) by means of the
Laird of Craigmiller, Provest, and some others, the summe was
made more easie, to wit, a 1000 marks sterling, to be paid
immediately, and to have the superioritie of Leith in pledge,
(to wit,) upon condition of redemption.<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a> And besides the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
sum of 1000 marks sterling, they paid £1000 sterling for the
meeting at Dumfries. At the day appointed, for electing the
officers, the Queen sent in a ticket, such as she would have
them chuse for Provest, Bailiffs, and Councell, whereof there
was a number of Papists, the rest not worthy. Of the number
given in by the Queen, they named such as should rule for
that year; notwithstanding, without free election, the Laird
[of] Craigmiller remained Provest,<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> who shewed himself most
willing to set forward Religion, to punish vice, and to maintain
the Commonwealth. All this time the Ministers cried
out against the Masse, and such idolatry; for it was more advanced
by the Queen then before.</p>

<p>The first day of October, met in Edinburgh the Superintendant
of Lothian, with all the Ministers under his charge, according
to their ordinary custom; for every Superintendant
used to convene the whole Ministry, and there it was complained
on, that they could get no payment of their stipends,
not only about the city, but thorow the whole Realm. Therefore,
after reasoning and consultation taken, they framed a
Supplication, directed to the King and Queen, and immediately
presented the same to their Majesties, by Master John
Spottswood, Superintendant of Lothian, and Master David
Lindsey, Minister of Leith: It contained in effect, that forasmuch
as it had pleased the King and Queen's Majesties, (with
advice of the Privy Councell,) to grant unto the Ministers of
the Word their Stipends, to be taken of the Thirds of the Benefices,
which Stipends are now detained from the said Ministers
by reason of the troubles, and changing of the Comptroller,
whereby they are not able to live; and therefore most
humbly craved the King and Queen's Majesty to cause them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
to be paid. Their answer was, That they would cause order
to be taken therein to their contentment.</p>

<p>Soon after the Lord Gordon came to Edinburgh, and left
the most part of his people at Sterlin with his carriage; the
King and Queen, for hope of his good service to be done,
restored him to his father's place, to the Earldom of Huntley,
the lands and heritage thereof.</p>

<p>October 8. the King and Queen marched forth of Edinburgh
towards Dumfries, and as they passed from the Palace of Hallyrud-house,
all men were warned with jack and spear. The
first night they came to Sterlin, and the next to Craford. The
day after, the Lairds of Drumlanrick and Lochinvar met the
Queen, albeit they had been with the Lords familiar enough.</p>

<p>The Lords perceiving that all hope of reconciliation was past,
they rode to Ednam [Annan], where they remained till the
Queen came to Dumfries, and then they past to Carlile. Now
the Master of Maxwell, who had entertained the Lords familiarly,
and subscribed with them, and had spoken as highly against
their enemies as any of themselves, and had received large
money by that means, to wit, £1000, to raise a band or troup
of horsemen; and that the same day the King and Queen came
to Dumfries; the third day after their coming, he came to
them, conveyed by the Earl Bothwell, with divers other Noblemen.
At length the Earls of Athole and Huntley were sureties
for him, and all things past remitted, upon condition that
he should be a faithfull and obedient subject hereafter. The
same day they made musters; the next day the army was
dispersed, being about 18,000 men: the King and Queen past
to Lochmaben, where the Master of Maxwell gave a banquet,
and then forthwith marched to Tweddall, so to Peblis, and
then to Edinburgh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Here mark

or a

<p>The best and chief part of the Nobility of this Realm, who
also were the principal instruments of the Reformation of
Religion, and therefore were called the Lords of the Congregation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
in manner above rehearsed, were banished and chased
into England: they were courteously received and entertained
by the Earl of Bedford, Lieutenant, upon the Borders of
England. Soon after the Earle of Murray took post towards
London, leaving the rest of the Lords at Newcastle; every
man supposed that the Earl of Murray should have been graciously
received of the Queen of England, and that he should
have gotten support according to his heart's desire; but far
beyond his expectation, he could get no audience of the Queen
of England: But by means of the French Ambassadour,
called Monsieur De Four, his true friend, he obtained audience.
The Queen, with a fair countenance, demanded, "How he, being
a rebel to her Sister of Scotland, durst take the boldness
upon him to come within her Realm?" These, and the like
words got he, instead of the good and courteous entertainment
expected. Finally, after private discourse, the Ambassadour
being absent, she refused to give the Lords any support,
denying plainly that ever she had promised any such thing as
to support them, saying, "She never meant any such thing in
that way;" albeit her greatest familiars knew the contrary.
In the end, the Earl of Murray said to her, "Madam, whatsoever
thing your Majesty meant in your heart, we are thereof
ignorant; but thus much we know assuredly, that we had
lately faithfull promises of aid and support by your Ambassadour,
and familiar servants, in your name: and further, we
have your own hand-writting, confirming the said promises."
And afterward he took his leave, and came northward from
London, towards Newcastle. After the Earl of Murray his
departure from the Court, the Queen sent them some aid, and
writ unto the Queen of Scotland in their favour: Whether
[it was] she had promised it in private to the Earl of Murray,
or whether she repented her of the harsh reception of the
Earl of Murray.</p>

<p>At this time David Rizio, Italian, began to be higher exalted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
insomuch as there was no matter or thing of importance
done without his advice. And during this time, the faithfull
within this Realm were in great fear, looking for nothing but
great trouble and persecution to be shortly. Yet supplications
and intercessions were made thorowout all the congregations,
especially for such as were afflicted and banished, that it
would please God to give them patience, comfort, and constancy;
and this especially was done at Edinburgh, where
John Knox used to call them that were banished, the best
part of the Nobility, Chief members of the Congregation:
Whereof the Courtiers being advertised, they took occasion to
revile and bewray his sayings, alledging, He prayed for the
rebels, and desired the people to pray for them likewise. The
Laird of Lethington, chief Secretary, in presence of the King
and Queen's Majesties and Councell, confessed that he heard
the sermons, and said, There was nothing at that time spoken
by the minister, whereat any man need to be offended: and
further, declared plainly, That by the Scripture it was lawfull
to pray for all men.</p>

<p>In the end of November, the Lords, with their complices,
were summoned to appear the fourth day of February, for
treason, and <i>L&oelig;se-majestie</i>: But in the mean time, such of
the Nobility as had professed the evangell of Christ, and had
communicate with the Brethren at the Lord's Table, were ever
longer the more suspected by the Queen, who began to declare
her self, in the months of November and December, to be maintainer
of the Papists; for at her pleasure the Earls of Lennox,
Athole, and Cassels, with divers others, without any dissimulation
known, went to the Masse openly in her chappell: Yet,
nevertheless, the Earls of Huntley and Bothwell went not to
Masse, albeit they were in great favour with the Queen. As
for the King, he past his time in hunting and hawking, and such
other pleasures as were agreeable to his appetite, having in his
company gentlemen willing to satisfy his will and affections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>About this time, in the beginning of<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> [the year 1565-6,]
as the Court remained at Edinburgh, the banished Lords, by
all means possible, by writings and their friends, made suit
and means to the King and Queen's Majesties, to be received
into favour.</p>

<p>At this time the Abbot of Kylwinning came from Newcastle
to Edinburgh, and after he had gotten audience of
the King and Queen, with great difficulty he got pardon for the
Duke and his friends and servants, upon this condition, that
he should pass into France; which he did soon after.<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a></p>

<p>The five and twentieth of December convened in Edinburgh
the Commissioners of the churches within this Realm, for the
Generall Assemblie: There assisted to them the Earls of Morton
and Marr, the Lord Lindsay, and Secretary Lethington,
with some Barons and gentlemen. The principall things that
were agreed and concluded, were, That forasmuch as the Masse,
with such idolatry and Papisticall ceremonies, were still maintained
expressly against the Act of Parliament, and the proclamations
made at the Queen's arrivall; and that the Queen
had promised that she would hear conference and disputation;
that the Church therefore offered to prove by the Word of God,
that the doctrine preached within this Realm was according to
the Scriptures; and that the Masse, with all the Papisticall
doctrine, was but the invention of men, and mere idolatry.
Secondly, That by reason of the change of the Comptroller,
who had put in new collectors, forbidding them to deliver any
thing to the Ministry, and by these means the Ministry was
like to decay and faill, contrary to the ordinance made in the
yeer of God 1562, in favour and support of the Ministry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>During this time, as the Papists flocked to Edinburgh for
making court, some of them that had been Friers, as black
Abercrommy and Roger, presented supplication to the Queen's
Majesty, desiring in effect, that they might be permitted to
preach; which was easily granted. The noyse was further,
that they offered disputation: For as the Court stood, they
thought they had a great advantage already, by reason they
knew the King to be of their Religion, as well as the Queen,
with some part of the Nobility, who with the King after
declared themselves openly: And especially the Queen was
governed by the Earls of Lennox and Athole; but in matters
most weighty and of greatest importance, by David
Rizio, the Italian afore mentioned, who went under the name
of the French Secretary; by whose means, all grave matters,
of what weight soever, must pass; providing always, that
his hands were anoynted. In the mean time he was a manifest
enemy to the Evangell, and therefore a greater enemy to
the banished Lords. And at this time, the principall Lords
that waited at Court were divided in opinions; for the Earl of
Morton, Chancellor, with the Earl of Marr, and Secretary Lethington,
were on the one part; and the Earls of Huntley and
Bothwell on the other part, so that a certain drynesse was
amongst them; nevertheless, by means of the Earl of Athole,
they were reconciled. Now, as there was preparation made by
the Papists for Christmas, the Queen being then at Masse, the
King came publikely, and bare company; and the Friers
preached the days following, always using another stile then
they had done seven years before, during which time they had
not preached publikely: they were so little esteemed, that
they continued not long in preaching.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At the end
of this
Book you
shall finde
this.</div>

<p>At the same time, convened in Edinburgh the Generall Assembly<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a>
of the Ministers, and Commissioners of the Churches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
Reformed within this Realm: There assisted them of the
Nobility, the Earls of Morton and Marr, the Lord Lindsay, and
Secretary Lethington, with others. The chief things that were
concluded in this Assembly, were, That for the avoyding of the
plagues and scourges of God, which appeared to come upon the
people for their sins and ingratitude, there should be proclaimed
by the Ministers a Publike Fast,<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> to be universally observed
thorowout all the Reformed Churches; which manner of Fasting
was soon after devised by John Knox, at the command
of the Church, and put in print, wherefore needs not here to
be recited in this place. What followed upon the said Fast,
shall be plainly, God willing, declared. The second thing that
was ordained in this Assembly, was, concerning the Ministers,
who, for want of payment of their stipends, were like to perish,
or else to leave their Ministry; wherefore it was found necessary,
that Supplication should be made to the King and
Queen's Majesties: And for the same purpose, a certain number
of the most able men were elected to go to their Majesties
aforesaid, to lament and bemoan their case; which persons
had commission to propose some other things, as shall be
declared.</p>

<p>The names of them that past from the Church to the King
and Queen's Majesties, were, Master John Spotswood, Superintendent
of Lowthian; John Winrame, Superintendent of Fyfe;
Master John Row, Minister of Perth; Master David Lindsay,
Minister of Leith; who easily obtained audience of the King
and Queen's Majesties: And after their reverence done, Master
John Row, in name of the rest, opened the matter, lamenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
and bewailing the miserable state of the poor Ministers,
who by publike command had been reasonably satisfied three
years or more, by virtue of the Act made with advice of the
Honourable Privie Councell, for the taking up of the Thirds
of the Benefices, which was especially made in their favours:
Nevertheless the Laird of Tillibardin, new Comptroller, would
answer them nothing; wherefore, they besought their Majesties
for relief.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Seeing that in all supplications made to the King
and Queen's Majesties by the Church at all times, they desired
most earnestly that all idolatry and superstition, and especially
the Masse, should be rooted out and abolished quite out of
this Realm; and that in the last Generall Assembly of the
Church, by their Commissioners, they had most earnestly desired
the same; and that their answer was then, that they
knew no impediment in the Masse; therefore, the Assembly
desired, That it might please their Highnesses to hear disputation,
to the end that such as now pretend to preach in the
Chappell Royall, and maintain such errours; the truth being
tryed by disputation, that they might be known to be abusers,
submitting themselves always to the word of God written in
the Scriptures.</p>

<p>To this it was answered by the Queen, That she was always
minded that the Ministers should be paid their stipends;
and if there was any fault therein, the same came by some
of their own sort, meaning the Comptroller Pittarow,<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> who
had the handling of the Thirds: Always by the advice of her
Councell she should cause such order to be taken therein, that
none should have occasion to complain. As to the second,
She would not jeopard her Religion upon such as were there
present; for she knew well enough that the Protestants were
more learned.</p>

<p>The Ministers and Commissioners of Churches perceiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
nothing but delay, and driving off time in the old manner,
went home every one to their own churches, waiting upon the
good providence of God, continually making supplication unto
Almighty God, that it would please him of his mercy to remove
the apparent plague. And in the mean time the Queen
was busied with banquetting about with some of the Lords of
the Session of Edinburgh, and after with all men of law, having
continually in her company David Rizio, who sat at table near
to her self, sometimes more privately then became a man of
his condition, for his over-great familiarity was already suspected;
and it was thought, that by his advice alone the
Queen's sharpness and extremity towards the Lords was maintained.</p>

<p>In the end of January, arrived an Ambassadour from France,
named Monsieur Rambullet,<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> having with him about fourty
horse in trayn, who came thorow England. He brought with
him the Order of the Cockle from the King of France, to
the King, who received the same at the Masse, in the Chappell
of the Palace of Halyrud-house. There assisted the Earls of
Lenox, Athole, and Eglington, with diverse such other Papists
as would please the Queen; who, three days after, caused the
herald to convene in Councell, and reasoned what armes should
be given to the King: some thought he should have the Armes
of Scotland; some others said, Seeing it was not concluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
in Parliament, that he should have the Crown Matrimoniall,
he could have armes but only as Duke of Rothesay, Earl of
Rosse, &amp;c. The Queen bade give him only his due; whereby
it was perceived her love waxed cold towards him. Finally,
his armes were left blank; and the Queen caused put her own
name before her husband's in all writs; and thereafter she
caused to leave out his name wholly: And because formerly
he had signed every thing of any moment, she caused to make
a seal like the King's, and gave it to David Rizio, who made
use of it by the Queen's command, alleadging, That the King
being at his pastime, could not always be present.</p>

<p>About the same time, the Earle of Glencarne came from
Barwicke to his own country. Soon after the Earle of Bothwell
was married unto the Earle of Huntley his sister. The
Queen desired that the marriage might be made in the Chappell
at the Masse; which the Earle Bothwell would in no wise
grant. Upon Sunday, the third day of March, began the fasting
at Edinburgh. The seventh day of March, the Queen
came from the Pallace of Hallirud-house to the Town, in wondrous
gorgious apparell, albeit the number of Lords and train
was not very great. In the mean time the King, accompanied
with seven or eight horse, went to the Leith to pass his time
there, for he was not like to get the Crown Matrimoniall.</p>

<p>In the Tolbooth was devised and named the heads of the
Articles that were drawn against the banished Lords. Upon
the morrow, and Saturday following, there was great reasoning
concerning the Attainder: some alleadged, that the summons
was not well libelled or dressed; others thought the matter of
treason was not sufficiently proved; and indeed they were still
seeking proof, for there was no other way but the Queen
would have them all attainted, albeit the time was very short;
the twelfth day of March should have been the day, which was
the Tuesday following.</p>

<p>Now, the matter was stayed by a marvellous tragedy, for by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
the Lords, (upon the Saturday before, which was the ninth of
March, about supper-time,) David Rizio the Italian, named the
French Secretary, was slain in the gallery, below stairs, (the
King staying in the room with the Queen, told her, that the
designe was only to take order with that villain,) after that he
had been taken violently from the Queen's presence, who requested
most earnestly for the saving of his life: which act
was done by the Earle of Morton, the Lord Ruthven, the Lord
Lindsay, the Master of Ruthven, with divers other Gentlemen.
They first purposed to have hanged him, and had provided
cords for the same purpose; but the great haste which they
had, moved them to dispatch him with whingers or daggers,
wherewith they gave him three and fifty strokes. They sent
away, and put forth all sich persons as they suspected.</p>

<p>The Earles Bothwell and Huntley hearing the noise and
clamour, came suddenly to the Close, intending to have made
work, if they had had a party strong enough; but the Earle
Morton commanded them to pass to their chamber, or else they
should do worse: At the which words they retyred immediately,
and so past forth at a back window, they two alone,
and with great fear came forth of the town to Edmistone, on
foot, and from thence to Crichton.</p>

<p>This David Rizio was so foolish, that not only he had drawn
unto him the managing of all affaires, the King set aside, but
also his equipage and train did surpass the King's; and at the
Parliament that was to be, he was ordained to be Chancellour;
which made the Lords conspire against him: They made a
bond to stand to the religion and liberties of the countrey,
and to free themselves of the slavery of the villain David
Rizio: The King and his father subscribed to the Bond,<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> for
they durst not trust the King's word without his signet.</p>

<p>There was a French priest (called John Daniot) who advised
David Rizio to make his fortune, and be gone, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
Scots would not suffer him long. His answer was, That the
Scots would bragg but not fight. Then he advised him to beware
of the bastard. To this he answered, That the bastard
should never live in Scotland in his time; (he meant the Earl
Murray,) but it happened that one George Dowglas, bastard
son to the Earl of Angus, gave him the first stroke. The
Queen, when she heard he was dead, left weeping, and declared
she would study revenge, which she did.</p>

<p>Immediately it was noised in the town of Edinburgh, that
there was murther committed within the King's Palace, wherefore
the Provest caused to ring the common bell, or, <i>Sonner le
toksain</i>, (as the French speaks,) and straightway past to the
Palace, having about four or five hundred men in warlike manner;
and as they stood in the utter court, the King called to
the Provest, commanding him to pass home with his company,
saying, The Queen and he were merry. But the Provest desired
to hear the Queen speak her self; whereunto it was
answered by the King, "Provest, know you not that I am King?
I command you to pass home to your houses;" and immediately
they retired.</p>

<p>The next day (which was the second Sunday of our Fast in
Edinburgh) there was a proclamation made in the King's
name, subscribed with his hand, That all Bishops, Abbots, and
other Papists should avoid and depart the town; which proclamation
was indeed observed, for they had "a flea in their
hose." There were letters sent forth in the King's name, and
subscribed with his hand, to the Provest and Bailiffs of Edinburgh,
the Bailiffs of Leith and Canongate, commanding them
to be ready in armour to assist the King and his company,
and likewise other private writings directed to divers Lords
and gentlemen, to come with all expedition. In the mean
time, the Queen, being above measure enraged, offended, and
troubled, as the issue of the matter declared, sometime railing
upon the King, and sometime crying out at the windows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
desired her servants to set her at libertie; for she was highly
offended and troubled.</p>

<p>This same tenth of March, the Earl of Murray, with the rest
of the Lords and Noblemen that were with him, having received
the King's letter, (for after the Bond, above named, was
subscribed, the King wrote unto the banished Lords to return
into their countrey, being one of the articles of the said Bond,)
came at night to the Abbey, being also convoyed by the Lord
Hume, and a great company of the Borderers, to the number
of 1000 horses. And first, after he had presented himself to
the King, the Queen was informed of his sudden coming, and
therefore sent unto him, commanding him to come to her;
and he obeying, went to her, who, with a singular gravitie
received him, after that he had made his purgation, and
declared the over-great affection which he bore continually to
her Majestie. The Earles of Athole, Cathnes, and Sutherland,
departed out of the town, with the Bishops, upon the Munday,
the third day after the slaughter of David Rizio. The Earls
of Lenox, Murray, Morton, and Rothes, Lords Ruthven,
Lindsay, Boyd, and Ochiltrie, sitting in Councell, desired the
Queen, that forasmuch as the thing which was done could
not be undone, that she would (for avoiding of greater inconveniences)
forget the same, and take it as good service, seeing
there were so many Noblemen restored. The Queen dissembling
her displeasure and indignation, gave good words, nevertheless
she desired, That all persons armed or otherwise, (being
within the Palace at that time,) should remove, leaving
the Palace void of all, saving only her domestick servants.
The Lords being perswaded by the uxorious King, and the
facile Earl of Murray, condescended to her desire, who finally,
the next morning, two hours before day, past to Seaton, and
then to Dumbar, having in her company the simple King, who
was allured by her sugred words. From Dumbar immediately
were sent pursuivants with letters thorowout the countrey;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
and especially letters to the Noblemen and Barons, commanding
them to come to Dumbar, to assist the King and Queen
within five days. In the mean time the Lords being informed
of the [Queen's] sudden departure, they were astonished,
and knew not what were best for them to do: But because
it was the self-same day (to wit, the twelfth day of March)
that they were summoned unto; therefore, having good opportunity,
they past to the Tolbooth, which was richly hung with
tapistry, and adorned, (but not for them,) and set themselves,
making protestations, the Earl of Glencarne, and some others
being present. The Earl of Argyle, who was written for by
the King, came to Lithgow; and being informed of the
matter, he remained there.</p>

<p>After this manner above specified, to wit, by the death of
David Rizio, the Noblemen were relieved of their trouble, and
restored to their places and rooms: And likewise the Church
Reformed, and all that professed the Evangell within this
Realm, after fasting and prayer, was delivered and freed from
the apparent dangers which were like to have fallen upon
them; for if the Parliament had taken effect, and proceeded,
it was thought by all men of the best judgement, that the
true Protestant Religion should have been wrackt, and Popery
erected; and for the same purpose, there were certain woodden
altars made, to the number of twelve, found ready in the
Chappell of the Palace of Halyrud-House, which should have
been erected in Saint Gyles his Church.</p>

<p>The Earls Bothwell and Huntley being informed of the King
and Queen's sudden departure forth of Edinburgh, came to
Dumbar, where they were most graciously received by the
Queen's Majesty; who consulting with them and the Master of
Maxwell, together with Parson Owin<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> and Parson Fliske,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a>
chief Councellors, what was best to be done, and how she
should be revenged upon the murtherers. At first they did
intend to go forward, and leaving no manner of cruelty unpractised,
putting to death all such as were suspected: This
was the opinion of such as would obey their Queen's rage and
fury for their own advantage; but in the end they concluded,
that she should come to Edinburgh with all the force and
power she could make, and there proceed to justice: and for
the same purpose, she caused to summon, by open proclamation,
all persons of defence, and all Noblemen and Gentlemen, to
come to her in Dumbar incontinent. In the mean time, the
Captains laboured by all means to take up, and enroll men and
women. The Earles of Morton, Murray, Glencarne, Rothesse,
with the rest that were in Edinburgh, being informed of the
Queen's fury and anger towards the committers of the slaughter;
and perceiving they were not able to make any party, thought
it best to give place to her fury for a time; for they were
divided in opinions, and finally, departed out of Edinburgh,
upon Sunday the seventeenth of March, every one a severall
way; for the Queen's Majesty was now bent only against the
slayers of David Rizio; and to the purpose she might be the
better revenged upon them, she intended to give pardon to all
such as before had been attainted, for whatsoever crime.</p>

<p>The eighteenth day of March, the King and Queen came to
Edinburgh, having in their company horse and foot to the
number of 8000 men; whereof there were four companies of
foot-men of war. The Town of Edinburgh went out to meet
them, for fear of war. And finally, coming within the town, in
most awfull manner they caused to place their men of war
within the town, and likewise certain field-pieces against their
lodging, which was in the middle of the town, over against the
Salt Trone: Now, a little before the Queen's entrance into the
town, all that knew of her cruell pretence and hatred towards
them, fled here and there, and amongst others, Master James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
Macgill the Clerk Register, the Justice Clerk, and the common
Clerk of the town:<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> The chief Secretary Lethington was
gone before; likewise John Knox past west to Kyle: The men
of war likewise kept the ports or gates. Within five days after
their entry, there was a proclamation made at the Market-Cross,
for the purgation of the King from the aforesaid
slaughter; which made all understanding men laugh at the
passages of things, since the King not only had given his consent,
but also had subscribed the bond afore-named; and the
business was done in his name, and for his honour, if he had
had wisdom to know it.</p>

<p>After this proclamation, the King lost his credit among all
men, and so his friends, by this his inconstancy and weakness.
And in the mean time, the men of war committed great
outrages in breaking up doors, thrusting themselves into every
house: And albeit the number of them were not great, yet
the whole town was too little for them. Soon after, the King
and Queen past to the Castle, and caused to warn all such as
had absented themselves, by open proclamation, to appear before
their Majesties and the Privy Councell within six days,
under pain of rebellion; which practice was devised in the
Earl of Huntley's case, before the battle of Corrichy. And
because they appeared not, they were denounced rebells, and
put to the horne, and immediately thereafter, their escheats
given or taken up by the Treasurer. There was a certain
number of the townsmen charged to enter themselves prisoners
in the Tolbooth, and with them were put in certain
gentlemen: where, after they had remained eight days, they
were convoyed down to the Palace by the men of war, and
then kept by them eight days more: And of that number
was Thomas Scot,<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> Sheriff-depute of Saint Johnston, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
condemned to death, and executed cruelly, to wit, hanged and
quartered, for keeping the Queen in prison, as was alleadged,
although it was by the King's command: And two men likewise
were condemned to death, and carried likewise to the
ladder foot; but the Earl Bothwell presented the Queen's ring
to the Provest, which then was justice, for safety of their life.
The names of those two were John Mowbray, merchant, and
William Harlow, sadler. About the same time, notwithstanding
all this hurliburly, the Ministers of the Church and professors
of Religion ceased not; as for the people, they convened
to publike prayers and preaching with boldness; yea, a
great number of Noblemen assisted likewise. The Earl Bothwell
had now, of all men, greatest access and familiarity
with the Queen, so that nothing of any great importance was
done without him; for he shewed favour to such as liked
him; and amongst others, to the Lairds of Ormeston, Hawton,
and Calder,<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> who was so reconciled unto him, that by his
favour they were relieved of great trouble.</p>

<p>The Earls of Argyle and Murray, at the Queen's command,
past to Argyle, where, after they had remained about a month,
they were sent for by the Queen; and coming to Edinburgh,
they were received by the Queen into the Castle, and banquetted,
the Earls of Huntley and Bothwell being present.
At this time the King grew to be contemned and disesteemed,
so that scarcely any honour was done to him, and his Father
likewise.</p>

<p>About Easter, the King past to Sterlin, where he was shriven
after the Papist manner: and in the meane time, at the
Palace of Halyrud-house, in the Chappell, there resorted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
great number to the Masse, albeit the Queen remained still in
the Castle, with her Priests of the Chappell Royall, where they
used ceremonies after the Popish manner.</p>

<p>At the same time departed this life, Master John Sinclair,
Bishop of Rosse [Brechin], and Dean of Restalrig, of whom
hath been oft mention, President of the Colledge of Justice,
called the Session; who also succeeded in the said office and
dignity after the decease of his brother, Master John [Henry]
Sinclair, Bishop of Rosse, Dean of Glasgow, who departed this
life at Paris, about a year before. They were both learned in
the laws, and given to maintain the Popish religion, and
therefore great enemies to the Protestants. A little before
died Master Abraham Crichton, who had been President likewise.<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a>
Now, in their rooms, the Queen placed such as she
pleased, and had done her service, (always very unfit.) The
patrimony of the Kirk, Bishopricks, Abbeys, and such other
Benefices, were disposed by the Queen to courtiers, dancers,
and flatterers. The Earl Bothwell, whom the Queen preferred
above all others, after the decease of David Rizio, had for his
part Melrosse, Hadington, and New Battell; likewise the
Castle of Dumbar was given to him, with the principall lands
of the Earldom of Merche, which were of the patrimony of the
Crown.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Superintendents, with the other Ministers
of the Churches, perceiving the Ministery like to decay
for lack of payment of stipends to Ministers, they gave this
Supplication at Edinburgh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
<i>The Supplication of the Ministers to the Queen.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"Unto</span> your Majesty, and your most honourable Councel,
most humbly and lamentably complains your Highnesse poor
Orators, the Superintendents, and other Ministers of the Reformed
Church of God, travelling thorowout all your Highnesse
Realm, in teaching and instructing your lieges in all quarters,
in the knowledge of God, and Christ Jesus his Sonne; That
where your Majesty, with the advice of the Councell and
Nobility aforesaid, moved by godly zeal, concluded and determined,
that the travelling ministry thorowout this Realm,
should bee maintained upon the rents of the Benefices of this
Realm of Scotland; and for that cause your Majestie, with the
advice of the Counsell and Nobility aforesaid, upon the 15. day
of December 1562, in like manner concluded and determined,
That if the said part of the rents of the whole Benefices Ecclesiasticall
within this Realm would be sufficient to maintain
the Ministers thorowout the whole Realm, and to support your
Majesty in the setting forward of your common affaires, should
be employed accordingly: Failing thereof, the Third part of
the said fruits, or more, to be taken up yearly in time comming,
untill a generall order be taken therein; as the act made
thereupon at more length bears: Which being afterward considered
by your Majestie, the whole Thirds of the fruits aforesaid
were propounded to the uses aforesaid, by Act of Councell.
And we your Majestie's poore Orators, put in peaceable possession
of the part assigned by your Majestie to us, by the space
of three years, or thereabouts, which we did enjoy without interruption;
notwithstanding all this, now of late, we your
Majestie's poore Orators aforesaid, are put wrongfully and unjustly
from their aforesaid part of the above specified Thirds,
by your Majestie's officers, and thereby brought to such extreme
penury, and extreme distress, as we are not able any longer
to maintain our selves. And albeit we have given in divers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
and sundry complaints to your Majestie herein, and have received
divers promises of redress, yet have we found no relief:
Therefore, we most humbly beseech your Majesty to consider
our most grievous complaint, together with the right above specified,
whereon the same is grounded. And if your Majesty, with
the advice of your Councell aforesaid, finds our right sufficient
to continue us in possession of our part assigned to us, while,
and untill a generall order be taken; which possession was
ratified by the yearly allowance of your Majesties Exchequer's
accompt, that your Majestie would grant us letters upon the
aforesaid Act and Ordinance past thereupon, against all intromettors
and medlers with the aforesaid Thirds, to answer and
obey, according to the aforesaid Act and Ordinance of our
possession proceeding thereupon; and likewise, that we may
have letters, if need be, to arrest and stay the aforesaid Thirds
in the possessor's hands, while, and untill sufficient caution be
found to us for our part aforesaid. And your Answer most
humbly we beseech."</p></blockquote>

<p>This Supplication being presented by the Superintendent of
Lowthian, and Master John Craig, in the Castle of Edinburgh,
was graciously received by the Queen, who promised that she
would take sufficient order therein, so soon as the Nobility and
Councell might convene.</p>

<p>The 19. of June, the Queen was delivered of a man childe,
(the Prince in the aforesaid Castle,) [who after was named
James,]<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> and immediately sent into France and England her
posts, to advertise the neighbour Princes, and to desire them
to send gossips or witnesses to the Prince's baptisme. In
the mean time, there was joy and triumph made in Edinburgh,
and such other places where it was known, after thanks and
praises given unto God, with supplications for the godly education
of the Prince; and principally, wishing that he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
be baptized according to the manner and forme observed in
the Reformed Churches within this Realm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[The order
Of Paul
Methven's
repentance.]</div>

<p>About the same time, to wit, the 25. of June, the Generall
Assembly of the whole Church convened at Edinburgh. The
Earles of Argyle and Murray assisted at the Assembly: Paul
Methven, who before, as we heard, was excommunicate, gave
in his Supplication, and desired to be heard, as he had done
divers times; for the said Paul had written oft times out of
England to the Laird of Dun, and to divers others, most earnestly
desiring to be received again into the fellowship of the
Church. After reasoning of the matter, it was finally granted,
that he should be heard: And so being before the Assembly,
and falling upon his knees, burst out with teares, and said,
He was not worthy to appeare in their presence; alwayes he
desired them, for the love of God, to receive him to the open
expression of his repentance. Shortly after, they appointed
certaine of the ministers to proscribe to him the forme of his
declaration of repentance, which was thus in effect; First, That
he should present himselfe bare-foot and bare-head, arayed in
sack-cloth, at the principall entry of Saint Gyles Kirk in Edinburgh,
at seven hours in the morning, upon the next Wednesday,
and there to remain the space of an hour, the whole people
beholding him, till the prayer was made, psalmes sung, and [the]
text of Scripture was read, and then to come into the place
appointed for expression of repentance, and tarry the time of
sermon; and to do so likewise the next Friday following, and
also upon the Sunday; and then, in the face of the whole
church, to declare his repentance with his owne mouth. The
same forme and manner he should use in Jedwart and Dundie:
And that being done, to present himself again at the next
Generall Assembly following in winter, where he should be
received to the communion of the Church. When the said
Paul had received the said Ordinance, he took it very grievously,
alleadging, they had used over-great severity: Neverthelesse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
being counselled and perswaded by divers notable
personages, he began well in Edinburgh to proceed, whereby
a great number were moved with compassion of his state; and
likewise in Jedwart: but he left his duty in Dundie, and
passing againe into England, the matter, not without offence
to many, ceased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">See in what
sense

<div class="sidenote">As is said
before.</div>

<p>The Ministers complaining that they could not be payed
their stipends, were licensed by the Assembly to passe to other
churches to preach, but in no wise to leave the ministery.
And because that the Queen's Majesty had promised often
before to provide remedy, it was thought expedient that supplication
should be yet made, as before, That the Queen's
Majestie should cause such order to be taken, that the poore
ministers might be payed their stipends. The Bishop of
Galloway, who was brother to the Earle of Huntley, and now
a great man in the Court, travelled much with the Queen's
Majesty in that matter, and got of her a good answer, and
faire promises. A few years before, the said Bishop of Galloway
desired of the Generall Assembly to be made Superintendent
of Galloway; but now being promoted to great dignity,
as to be of the number of the Lords of the Privy Councell,
and likewise one of the Session,<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> he would no more be called
Over-looker, or Over-seer of Galloway, but Bishop: Alwayes
truth it is, that he laboured much for his nephew the Earle of
Huntley, that he might be restored to his lands and honours;
for the said Earle was new Chancellor,<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> since the slaughter of
David Rizio, and had for his clawback the Bishop of Rosse,
Master John Lesley, one of the chief Councellors to the
Queen: But of all men the Earle Bothwell was most in the
Queen's favour, so far, that all things past by him; yea, by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
meanes the most part of all those that were partakers in the
slaughter of David Rizio, got remission and relief. But from
that day he was not present at any sermon, albeit before he
professed the Evangel by outward speaking, yet he never
joyned to the Congregation. But this time the Earle of Cassils<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a>
was contracted with the Lord of Glames sister, by whose
perswasion he became a Protestant, and caused, in the moneth
of August, to reforme his churches in Carrick, and promised to
maintaine the doctrine of the Evangell.</p>

<p>The Queen, not yet satisfied with the death of her man
David, caused in August to be apprehended a man called Hary,<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a>
who sometime had been of her Chapell-Royall, but afterward
became an exhorter in a Reformed Church; and for want of
stipend, or other necessaries, past in service to my Lord Ruthven,
and chanced that night to be present when the said David
was slaine; and so, finally, he was condemned, and hanged,
and quartered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This inconstant

himselfe for

And now

And as he

left by him.</div>

<p>The King being now contemned of all men, because the
Queene cared not for him, he went sometime to the Lenox to
his father, and sometime to Sterlin, whither the Prince was
carried a little before. Alwayes he was destitute of such things
as were necessary for him, having scarcely six horses in trayn.
And being thus desolate, and halfe desperate, he sought
means to go out of the countrey: and, about the same time,
by the advice of foolish cagots, he wrote to the Pope, to the
King of Spaine, and to the King of France, complaining of the
state of the countrey, which was all out of order, all because
that Masse and Popery were not againe erected, giving the
whole blame thereof to the Queen, as not managing the Catholike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
cause aright. By some knave, this poore Prince was betrayed,
and the Queen got a copie of these letters into her
hands, and therefore threatened him sore; and there was never
after that, any appearance of love betwixt them.</p>

<p>The Churches of Geneva, Berne, and Basill, with other Reformed
Churches of Germany and France, sent to the whole
Church of Scotland the sum of the Confession of their Faith,<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a>
desiring to know if they agreed in uniformity of doctrine, alleadging,
that the Church of Scotland was dissonant in some
Articles from them: Wherefore the Superintendents, with a
great part of the other most qualified Ministers, convened in
September in Saint Andrews, and reading the said letters,
made answer, and sent word again, That they agreed in all
points with those Churches, and differed in nothing from them:
albeit in the keeping of some Festivall days, our Church assented
not; for only the Sabbath-day was kept in Scotland.</p>

<p>In the end of this month, the Earl Bothwell, riding in pursuit
of the theeves in Liddisdale, was ill hurt, and worse terrified
by a thief; for he believed surely to have departed forth
of this life, and sent word thereof to the Queen's Majestie,
who soon after past forth of Jedwart to the Hermitage to visit
him,<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> and give him comfort: And within a few days after, she
took sickness in a most extreme manner, for she lay two hours
long cold dead, as it were without breath, or any sign of life:
at length she revived, by reason they had bound small cords
about her shackle bones, her knees, and great toes, and speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
very softly, she desired the Lords to pray for her to God.
She said the creed in English, and desired my Lord of Murray,
if she should chance to depart, that he would not be over extreme
to such as was of her Religion; the Duke and he should
have been Regents. The bruit went from Jedwart in the
month of October 1565, that the Queen was departed this life,
or, at least, she could not live any time, wherefore there was
continually prayers publikely made at the Church of Edinburgh,
and divers other places, for her conversion towards God,
and amendment. Many were of opinion that she should come
to the preaching, and renounce Popery; but all in vain, for
God had some other thing to do by her. The King being advertised,
rid post from Sterlin to Jedburgh, where he found
the Queen somewhat convalesced, but she would scarce speak
to him, and hardly give him presence or a good word; wherefore
he returned immediately to Sterlin, where the Prince was,
and after to Glasgow to his father.</p>

<p>There appeared great trouble over the whole Realm, and
especially in the countreys near the Borders, if the Queen had
departed at that time. As she began to recover, the Earl
Bothwell was brought in a charriot from the Hermitage to
Jedburgh, where he was cured of his wounds; in whose presence
the Queen took more pleasure then in all the rest of the
world: always by his means, most part of all that were outlawed
for the slaughter of David Rizzio, got relief, for there
was no other means, but all things must needs pass by him;
wherefore, every man sought to him, where immediately favour
was to be had, as before to David Rizio.</p>

<p>Soon after, the Queen passing along the Borders, she came
within the bounds of Barwick, where she viewed the town at
her pleasure afar off, being within half a mile and less. All
the ordnance within Barwick were discharged; the Captain
came forth, with fourscore horses bravely arrayed, to do her
honour, and offer her lawfull service. Then she came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
Craigmiller, where she remained in November, till she was advertised
of the coming of the Ambassadors to the baptisme of
the Prince; and for that purpose there was great preparation
made, not without the trouble of such as were supposed to
have money in store, especially of Edinburgh; for there was
borrowed a good round summe of money for the same businesse.
All her care and solicitude was for that triumph. At
the same time arrived the Counte de Briance, Ambassadour of
the King of France, who had a great train. Soon after the
Earl of Bedford went forth of England, with a very gorgious
company, to the number of fourscore horses, and passing to
Sterlin, he was humanly received of the Queen's Majestie, and
every day banquetted. The excessive expences, and superfluous
apparell, which was prepared at that time, exceeded
farr all the preparation that ever had been devised or set
forth afore that time in this countrey.</p>

<p>The 17. of December 1566, in the great hall of the Castle of
Sterling, was the Prince baptized<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> by the Bishop of Saint
Andrews, at five a clock at even, with great pomp, albeit with
great pain could they find men to beare the torches, wherefore
they took boyes. The Queen laboured much with the Noblemen
to bear the salt, grease, and candle, and such other things,
but all refused; she found at last the Earls of Eglington,
Athole, and the Lord Seaton, who assisted at the baptisme, and
brought in the said trash. The Counte de Briance, (being the
French Ambassadour,) assisted likewise. The Earl of Bedford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
brought for a present from the Queen of England a font of
gold, valued to be worth three thousand crowns. Soon after
the said baptisme, as the Earl was in communing with the
Queen, who entertained him most reverently, he began to say
merrily to her, amongst other talking, "Madame, I rejoyce
very greatly at this time, seeing your Majestie hath here to
serve you so many Noblemen, especially twelve Earls, whereof
two only assist at this baptisme to the superstition of Popery."
At the which saying the Queen kept good countenance. Soon
after they banquetted in the said great hall, where they wanted
no prodigality. During the time of the Earl of Bedford's
remaining at Sterlin, the Lords, for the most part, waited upon
him, and conveyed him every day to the sermon, and after to
banquetting.</p>

<p>The King, who remained at Sterlin all that time, (never being
present,) kept his chamber: His father hearing how he
was used, writ to him to repaire unto him; who soon after went
(without good-night) toward Glasgow, to his father. He was
hardly a mile out of Sterlin, when the poyson (which had been
given him) wrought so upon him, that he had very great pain
and dolour in every part of his body. At length, being arrived
at Glasgow, the blisters brake out, of a blewish colour; so the
Physitians presently knew the disease to come by poyson: He
was brought so low, that nothing but death was expected; yet
the strength of his youth at last did surmount the poison.</p>

<p>During the time of this triumph, the Queen was most liberall
in all things that were demanded of her: amongst other
things, she subscribed a writing for the maintenance of the
Ministers in a reasonable proportion, which was to be taken
up of the Thirds of Benefices: which writing being purchased
by the Bishop of Galloway, was presented at the Generall Assembly
of the Church at Edinburgh, the five and twentieth
day of December 1566, where were conveened the Superintendents,
and other Ministers in reasonable number, but very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
few Commissioners. The first matter that was there proposed,
was concerning the said writing lately obtained; and the most
part of the Ministers being demanded their opinions in the
matter, after advice, and passing a little aside, they answered
very gravely, That it was their duty to preach to the people
the word of God truly and sincerely, and to crave of the auditors
the things that were necessary for their sustentation, as
of duty the Pastour might justly crave of their flock; and,
further, it became them not to have any care. Nevertheless,
the Assembly taking into consideration, that the said gifts
granted by the Queen's Majestie was not to be refused, they
ordained, That certain faithfull men of every Shire should
meet, and do their utmost diligence for gathering and receiving
the said corn and money; and likewise appointed the Superintendent
of Lowthian, and Master John Row,<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> to waite
upon the Bishop of Galloway, and concurre and assist him for
further expedition in the Court, that the said gift might be
dispatched through the Seales.</p>

<p>In the same Assembly, there was presented a remonstrance
by writ, by some gentlemen of Kyle, containing in effect, That
inasmuch as the Tythes ought to be given only to the Ministers
of the Word, and Schools, and for maintenance of the
poore, that therefore the Assembly would statute and ordain,
That all the Professors of the Evangell should keep the same
in their own hands, to the effects aforesaid, and no way permit
the Papists to meddle therewith. This writing took no effect
at that time, for there was none else but the gentlemen of Kyle
of that opinion. It was statuted in the said Assembly, That
such publike fornicators, and scandalous livers, as would not
confesse their offences, nor come to declare their repentance,
should be declared by the Minister to be out of the Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
and not of the body thereof, and their names to be declared
publikely upon the Sunday.</p>

<p>After this Assembly, the Bishop of Galloway (with the

Sterlin, obtained their demands in an ample manner at the
Queen's Majesties hand, according to their desire; and likewise,
they obtained for every borough, a gift or donation of the
altarages, annuals, and obites, which before were given to the
Papists, now to be disposed for the maintenance of the
Ministers and Schools within the boroughs, and the rest to

<p>"<span class="smcap">Seeing</span> that Satan, by all our negligences, (Right Honourable,)
hath so far prevailed within this Realme of late dayes
that we do stand in extream danger, not onely to losse our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
temporall possessions, but also to be deprived of the glorious
Evangell of Jesus Christ, and so we and our posterity to be
left in damnable darknesse; We could no longer contain our
selves, nor keep silence, lest by so doing we might be accused
as guilty of the blood of such as shall perish for lack of admonition,
as the Prophet threatneth. We therefore, in the fear of
our God, and with grief and anguish of our heart, complain
unto your Honours, (yea, we must complain unto God, and to
all his obedient creatures,) that that conjured enemie of Jesus
Christ, and cruell murtherer of our dear brethren, most falsly
styled Archbishop of Saint Andrews, is reponed and restored,
by signature past, to his former tyrannie: For not only are
his ancient jurisdictions (as they are termed) of the whole
Bishoprick of Saint Andrews granted unto him, but also the
execution of judgement, confirmation of testaments, and donation
of benefices, as more amply in his signature is expressed.
If this be not to cure the head of that venomous beast, which
once within this Realm, by the potent hand of God, was so
broken downe and banished, that by tyranny it could not have
hurt the faithfull, judge ye. His ancient jurisdiction was, that
he with certaine colleagues collaterals, might have damned of
heresie upon probation as pleased him, and then to take all
that were suspected of heresie. What they have judged to be
heresie heretofore, ye cannot be ignorant of; and whether they
remaine in their former malice or not, their fruits and travels
openly declare. The danger may be feared, say ye. But
what remedie? It is easie, and at hand, (Right Honourable,)
if ye will not betray the cause of God, and leave your brethren,
who will never be more subject to that usurped tyrannie then
they will be to the Devill himselfe. Our Queene belike is
not well informed: She ought not, nor justly may not break
the laws of this Realm; and so consequently, she may not
set up against us, without our consents, that Romane Antichrist
againe: For in a lawfull and the most free Parliament that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
ever was in this Realm before, was that odious beast deprived
of all jurisdiction, office and authority within the Realm.
Her Majestie at her first arryvall, and by divers proclamations
sensyne, hath expressly forbidden any other forme and face of
Religion, then that which she found publikely established at
her arryvall: Therefore she may not bring us (the greatest
part of the subjects of this Realm) back again to bondage, till
that as lawfull and free a Parliament as justly damned that
Antichrist and his usurped tyranny, hath given decision betwixt
us and him. If hereof, and of other things which no lesse concerne
your selves then us, ye plainly and boldly admonish our
Soveraigne, and without tumult only crave justice, the tyrants
dare no more be seen in lawfull judgment, then dare the owles
in day light. Weigh this matter as it is, and ye will finde it
more weighty then it appeareth to many. Farther at this
present we complain not, but humbly crave of your Honours a
reasonable answer what ye will doe, in case such tyrants and
devouring wolves begin to invade the flocke of Jesus Christ
within this Realm, under what title soever it be: For this we
boldly professe, That we will never acknowledge such either
pastors to our soules, or yet judges to our causes. And if [that],
for denyall thereof, we suffer either in body or in goods, we
doubt not but we have not only a Judge to punish them that
unjustly trouble us, but also an Advocate and strong Champion
in Heaven to recompense them, who for his name's sake suffer
persecution: Whose Holy Spirit rule your hearts in his true fear

<p>Besides this Supplication of the Assembly to the Nobility
penned (as appeareth by the style) by John Knox, a Letter
was written by John Knox in particular to the Professors, to
advertise them of the danger of this commission or power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
granted to the said bastard, Bishop of Saint Andrews, the

<div class="sidenote">John Knox
his Letter
to the
Professors,</div>

<blockquote><p>"To deplore the miseries of these our most wicked dayes
(Beloved Brethren) can neither greatly profit us, neither yet
relieve us of our present calamities; and yet utterly to keep
silence, cannot lack the suspicion of apostacie, and plain defection
from God, and from his truth, once by us publikely professed.
For now are matters (that in years bypast have been
denyed) so far discovered, that he who seeth not the plaine
subversion of all true Religion within this Realm to be concluded,
and decreed in the hearts of some, must either confesse
himselfe blinde, or else an enemie to the Religion which we
professe: For besides the open erecting of Idolatry in divers
parts of this Realme, and besides the extreame povertie wherein
our Ministers are brought, (by reason that idle bellies are fed
upon that which justly appertaineth to such as truely preach
Jesus Christ, and rightly and by order minister his blessed
Sacraments,) that cruell murtherer of our brethren, falsly called
Archbishop of Saint Andrews, most unjustly, and against all
law, hath presumed to his former tyrannie, as a signature past
for his restitution to his ancient jurisdiction (as it is termed)
more fully doth proport. What end may be looked for of such
beginnings, the halfe blinde may see, as we suppose. And yet,
we have heard, that a certaine summe of money and victuals
should be assigned by the Queen's Majestie for sustentation of
our Ministrie. But how that any such assignation, or any promise
made thereof, can stand in any stable assurance, when that
Roman Antichrist (by just laws once banished from this
Realme) shall be intrused above us, we can no wise understand.
Yea, farther, we cannot see what assurance any within this
Realme that have professed the Lord Jesus can have of life or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
inheritance, if the head of that odious beast be cured amongst
us. And therefore we yet again, in the bowels of Christ Jesus,
crave of you to look into this matter, and to advertise us again,
with reasonable expedition of your judgements, that in the
feare of God, and with unitie of minds, we may proceed to
crave justice, and oppone our selves to such tyrannie, as most
unjustly is intended against us: For, if we think not that this
last erecting of that wicked man, is the very setting up againe
of that Romane Antichrist within this Realme, we are deprived
of all right judgement. And what is that else, but to separate
us and our posteritie from God; yea, and to cut our selves from
the freedome of this Realme. We desire therefore that the
wisest amongst you may consider the weight of this cause,
which long hath been neglected, partly by our slouth, and
partly by believing faire promises, by which to this hour we
have been deceived. And therefore we ought to be the more
vigilant and circumspect, especially seeing a Parliament is proclaimed.</p>

<p>"We have sent to you the forme of a Supplication and
Articles, which we would have presented to the Queen's
Majestie. If it please you, we would ye should approve it by
your subscriptions; or if you would alter it, we desire you so to
do, and we shall allow whatsoever you shall propound, not repugnant
to God. If it shall be thought expedient that Commissioners
of Countries shall conveene, to reason upon the most
weighty matters that now occurr, the time and place being
appointed by you, and due advertisement being given to us, by
God's grace, there shall no fault be found in us; but as from the
beginning we have neither spared substance nor life, so minde
we not to faint unto the end, to maintaine the same, so long
as we can finde the concurrence of brethren; of whom (as God
forbid) if we be destitute, yet are we determined never to be
subject to that Roman Antichrist, neither yet to his usurped
tyrannie. But when we can doe no further to suppresse that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
odious beast, we minde to scale with our blood to our posteritie,
that the bright knowledge of Jesus Christ hath banished that
man of sinne, and his venomous doctrine, from our hearts and
consciences. Let this our Letter and request beare witnesse
before God, before his angels, before the world, and before our
own consciences, that we require you that have professed the
Lord Jesus within this Realme, as well Nobilitie, as Gentlemen,
Burgesses, and Commons, to deliberate upon the estate of
things present; and specially whether that this usurped tyrannie
of that Romane Antichrist shall be any longer suffered within
this Realme, seeing that by just law it is already abolished.
Secondly, Whether that we shall be bound to feed idle bellies
upon the patrimonie of the Kirk, which justly appertaineth
unto Ministers. Thirdly, Whether that Idolatrie, and other
abominations, which now are more then evident, shall any
longer by us be maintained and defended. Answer us as ye
will answer to God, in whose feare we send these letters unto
you, lest that our silence should be counted for consent unto
such impietie. God take from our hearts the blinde love of
our selves, and all ungodly feare. Amen. Let us know your
mindes with expedition."]</p></blockquote>

<p>Notwithstanding the domestick troubles that the Church of

in England: Witnesse this Letter from the Generall Assembly

<p>"<span class="smcap">By</span> word and letters it is come to our knowledge, (Reverend
Brethren, Pastors of God's word in the Church of England,)
that divers of our Brethren (of whom some be of the most
learned in England,) are deprived from all Ecclesiasticall function,
namely, are forbidden to preach, and so by you are stopped
to promote the Kingdom of God, because they have a
scruple of conscience to use at the command of Authority such
garments as idolaters in time of greatest darknesse, did use in
their superstitious and idolatrous service; which report cannot
but be very grievous to our hearts, considering the sentence of
the Apostle, 'If ye bite and devour one another, take heed
ye be not consumed one of another.' We intend not at this
present to enter into the question, which we hear is agitated
and handled with greater vehemency by either partie, then
well liketh us, to wit, Whether such Apparell be accounted
amongst things indifferent or not; wherefore, (through the
bowels of Jesus Christ,) we crave that Christian charitie may
so farr prevaile with you, who are the pastors and guides of
Christ's flock in England, that ye doe one to another, as ye desire
others to do to you. You cannot be ignorant what tendernesse
is in a scrupulous conscience, and all that have knowledge
are not alike perswaded; the consciences of some of you
stirres not, with the wearing of such things; on the other side,
many thousands (both godly and learned) are otherwayes
perswaded, whose consciences are continually strucken with
these sentences, 'What hath Christ to doe with Beliall?' 'What
fellowship is there betwixt light and darknesse?' If surplice,
corner-cap, and tippet, have been the badges of idolaters in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
very act of their idolatry, what hath the preachers of Christian
libertie, and the rebukers of superstition to do with the dregs
of that Romish Beast? Yea, what is he that ought not to fear,
either to take in his hand, or on his forehead, the prints and
mark of that odious Beast? The brethren that refuse such
unprofitable apparell, do neither condemn nor molest you who
use such trifles. On the other side, if ye that use these things
will do the like to your brethren, we doubt not but therein
you shall please God, and comfort the hearts of many, which
are wounded to see extremitie used against these godly
brethren. Humane arguments or coloured rhetorick, we use
none to perswade you, only in charity we desire you to mind
the sentence of Peter, 'Feed the flock of Christ which is committed
to your charge, caring for it, not by constraint, but
willingly; not being as lords of God's heritages, but being examples
to the flock.' We further desire you to meditate upon
that sentence of Paul, 'Give no offence, neither to Jews, nor
Gentiles, nor to the church of God.' In what condition you
and we both travell, at least are bound to travell for the promoting
of Christ's kingdom, you are not ignorant; therefore
we are the more bold to exhort you to deal more wisely, then
to trouble the godly for such vanities; for all things which
seem lawfull, edifie not. If Authority urge you farther than
your consciences can bear, we pray you remember, that the Ministers
of the Church are called the 'Light of the world,' and
'Salt of the earth;' all civill authority hath not alwayes the
light of God shining before their eyes, in statutes and commands,
for their affections savour too much of the earth and
worldly wisdom: therefore we tell you, that ye ought to oppose
your selves boldly, not only to all power that dare extoll
it self against God, but also against all such as dare burthen the
consciences of the faithfull, farther than God chargeth them
in his own word. But we hope you will excuse our freedom
in that we have entered in reasoning farther than we intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
in the beginning. Now, again we return to our former request,
which is, That the brethren among you, who refuse the Romish
rags, may find of you, who use and urge them, such favour as
our Head and Master commandeth each one of his members to
shew to another, which we look to receive of your courtesie,
not only because you will not offend God in troubling your
brethren for such vain trifles, but also because you will not
refuse the earnest request of us your Brethren, and fellow
Ministers; in whom, although there appear no worldly pomp,
yet we are assured, you will esteem us as God's servants,
travelling to set forth his glory against the Roman Antichrist.
The dayes are evill, iniquitie aboundeth, and charitie
(alas) waxeth cold; wherefore we ought to walk diligently,
for the hour is uncertain when the Lord shall come, before
whom we must all give an account of our administration.
In conclusion, yet once more we desire you to be favourable
one to another; the Lord Jesus rule your hearts in his fear
unto the end, and give to you and us victorie over that
conjured enemy of true Religion, (the Pope,) whose wounded
head Sathan by all means strives to cure again; but to destruction
shall he go, and all his maintainers, by the power of
our Lord Jesus, to whose mighty protection we commit you.</p>

<p>"From our Generall Assembly, Decemb. 27. 1566."</p></blockquote>

<p>[When John Knox, the penner of this letter wrote thus of
the superstitious Apparell as a supplicant for the afflicted
Brethren, what would he have written, think you, in another
case. It is to be observed, that at the same time our worthy
Brethren in England made their state known to Master Beza,
who, upon their complaint, wrote a letter in their behalf at the
same time to Doctor Grindall, Bishop of London, wherein he
findeth fault with the manner of Apparrell appointed for Ministers
with kneeling at the communion, and all significant
ceremonies; which letter is the eight in order, among his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
Epistles. But obtaining no favour, he wrote the year following,
(which was in Anno 1567,) another letter to this purpose,
which is the twelfth in order amongst his Epistles, wherein he
giveth his beloved brethren this advice; that rather then they
should give their consents to the order of ordaining their Ministers
to use the cope and surplice, and to the manner of excommunication
that was used in the Church of England, that
they should give place to manifest violence, and live as privat
men. It is also to be observed, that the sincerer sort of the
Ministrie in England had not yet assaulted the jurisdiction
and Church government, (which they did not till the year
1572, at which time they published their first and second Admonition
to the Parliament,) but only had excepted against
superstitious apparell, and some other faults in the Service
Booke. By the former Assembly, the Reader of Bathgate was
censured for baptizing of infants, and solemnizing of marriage,
he being but a simple Reader, and for taking silver for the same
from such as were without the parish. Hear you may see
that they acknowledge not Reading Ministers, that is, that
any administer the Sacraments, but he that was able to preach
the word.]<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a></p>

<p>At the same time, the Bishop of Saint Andrews, by means
of the Earl Bothwell, procured a writing from the Queen's Majesty,
to be obeyed within the diocese of his jurisdiction, in all
such causes as before in time of Popery were used in the Consistory,
and therefore to discharge the new Commissioners;
and for the same purpose came to Edinburgh in January,
having a company of one hundred horses, or more, intending
to take possession, according to his gift lately obtained. The
Provest being advertised thereof by the Earl of Murray, they
sent to the Bishop three or four of the Councell, desiring him
to desist from the said matter, for fear of trouble and sedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
that might rise thereupon; whereby he was perswaded to desist
at that time.</p>

<p>Soon after, the Queen came to Edinburgh, where she remained
a few days. In the moneth of January she was informed
that the King was recovered of the poyson given him
at Sterlin, and therefore she past to Glasgow to visit him,
and there tarried with him six days, using him wonderfully
kindely, with many gracious and good words; and likewise
his father, the Earl of Lenox, insomuch that all men marvelled
whereto it should turn, considering the great contempt and
drynesse that had been before so long together. The Queen,
notwithstanding all the contempt that was given him, with a
known design to take away his life, yet by her sweet words
gains so far upon the uxorious husband, and his facile father,
that he went in company with her to Edinburgh, where she
had caused to lodge him at the Church of Field,<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> in a lodging,
lately bought by Master James Balfour, Clerk Register, truely
very unmeet for a King. The Queen resorted often to visit
him, and lay in the house two nights by him, (although her
lodging was in the Palace of Halyrud-house.) Every man
marvelled at this reconciliation and sudden change. The
ninth of February, the King was murthered, and the house
where he lay burned with powder, about twelve of the clock
in the night: his body was cast forth in a yard, without the
town wall, adjoining close by. There was a servant likewise
murthered beside him, who had been also in the chamber with
him. The people ran to behold this spectacle; and wondering
thereat some judged one thing, some another.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, Bothwell came from the Abbey with a
company of men of war, and caused the body of the King to
be carryed to the next house; where, after a little, the chirurgions
being convened at the Queen's command to view and
consider the manner of his death; most part gave out, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
please the Queen, that he was blown in the ayre, albeit he
had no mark of fire; and truly he was strangled. Soon after,<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a>
he was carryed to the Abbey, and there buryed.</p>

<p>[When many of the common people had gazed long upon the
King's corpse, the Queen caused it to be brought down to the
Pallace by some pioners. She behold the corpse without any
outward shew or signe of joy or sorrow. When the Lords had
concluded amongst themselves that he should be honourablie
buried, the Queen caused his corpse to be carried by some
pioners in the night without solemnitie, and to be layed beside
the sepulchre of David Rizio. If there had been any solemn
buriall, Buchanan had wanted wit to relate otherwise, seeing
there would have been so many witnesses to testifie the contrair.
Therefore the contriver of the late Historie of Queen
Marie<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> wanted policie here to convoy a lee.</p>

<p>The Queen, according to the ancient custom should have
keeped herself 40. days within, and the doores and windowes
should have been closed in token of mourning; but the windowes
were opened, to let in light, the fourth day. Before the
twelfth day, she went out to Scatoun, Bothwell never parting
from her side. There she went out to the fields to behold
games and pastimes. The King's armour, horse, and household
stuffe, were bestowed upon the murtherers. A certain taylour,
when he was to reforme the King's apparel to Bothwell, said
jestingly, He acknowledged here the custom of the country,
by which the clothes of the dead fall to the hangman.]<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span></p>
<p>This tragicall end had Henry Steward, after he had been
King eighteen moneths. A Prince of great linage, both by
mother and father: He was of a comely stature, and none
was like unto him within this island; he died under the age
of one and twenty years; prompt and ready for all games and
sports; much given to hawking and hunting, and running of
horses, and likewise to playing on the lute, and also to Venus
chamber: He was liberall enough: He could write and dictate
well; but he was somewhat given to wine, and much feeding,
and likewise to inconstancy; and proud beyond measure,
and therefore contemned all others: He had learned to dissemble
well enough, being from his youth misled up in Popery.
Thus, within two years after his arriving in this Realm, he
was highly by the Queen alone extolled; and, finally, had this
infortunate end by her procurement and consent. To lay all
other proofs aside, her marriage with Bothwell, who was the
main executioner of the King, notwithstanding all the advices
and counsells that the King of France, and the Queen of
England, did earnestly and carefully give her, as other friends
did likewise, witness anent their guilt. Those that laid hands
on the King to kill him, by Bothwell's direction, was Sir
James Balfour, Gilbert Balfour, David Chalmers, black John
Spense, Francis, Sebastien, Jo. de Bourdeau, and Joseph, the
brother of David Rizio: These last four were the Queen's
domesticks, and strangers. The reason why the King's death
was so hastened, because the affection or passion of the Earl
Bothwell could not bear so long a delay, as the procurement of
a bill of divorce required, although the Romish clergie offered
their service willingly to the business, namely, Bishop Hamilton,
and so he came great again at Court; and he for the advancement
of the business, did good offices to increase the
hatred betwixt the King and Queen; yea, some that had been
the chief instruments of the marriage of the King and Queen,
offered the service for the divorce, seeing how the Queen's inclination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
lay: So unhappy are Princes, that men, for their
own ends, further them in all their inclinations and undertakings,
be they never so bad or destructive to themselves.</p>

<p>The Earl of Lenox, in the mean time, wrote to the Queen,
to cause punish Bothwell, with his other complices, for murthering
the King. The Queen, not daring openly to reject the
Earl of Lenox his solicitation, did appoint a day for the triall
of Bothwell, by an assize;<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> the members whereof was the Earl
of Cathnes, President, the Earl of Cassels, (who at the first
refused, but thereafter, being threatened to be put in prison,
and under the pain of treason, was present by the Queen's
command,) John Hamilton, Commendator of Aberbrothok,
Lord Rosse, Lord Semple, Lord Boyd, Lord Hereis, Lord
Olyphant; the Master of Forbes, the Lairds of Lochinvar,
Langton, Cambusnetham,<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> Barnbougel, and Boyne: They, to
please the Queen, and for fear, did pronounce Bothwell not
guilty, notwithstanding the manifest evidences of the cruell
fact committed by Bothwell, who, before the tryall, did make
himself strong by divers means; namely, by the possession of
the Castle of Edinburgh, so that the accusers durst not appear,
not being strong enough. The Earl of Marr did retire to
Sterlin, and had committed to his charge the young Prince.
All this was done in February.</p>

<p>In April, Bothwell called together sundry of the Lords, who
had come to Edinburgh, to a meeting that was there; and
having gained some before, made them all, what by fear, what
by fair promises, first of their private state, and then of advancing
the Papist's Religion, to consent by their subscriptions
to the marriage with the Queen. Then the Queen goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
to Sterlin, to see her son: Bothwell makes a shew as if he
were going to the Borders to suppresse robbers, and so he
raiseth some men of war; which, when he had done, he turneth
towards the way to Sterlin, where he meets the Queen, according
to appointment betwixt them, and carrieth her to Dumbar,
as it had been by force, although every one knew it was with
the Queen's liking. The prime Nobility convened at Sterlin,
and from thence sent to her, to know whether or not she was
taken against her will: She answered, That it was true she
was taken against her will, but since her taking, she had
no occasion to complain; yea, the courteous entertainment
she had, made her forget and forgive all former offences.
Those expressions were used by way of preface to the pardon,
which was granted immediately thereafter to Bothwell; for, by
Letters Patents, he was pardoned by the Queen, for laying
violently hands upon her Majestie, and for all other crimes.
So by this, &amp;c.,<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> the murther of the King was pardoned.
During the Queen's abode in Dunbar, there was letters of
divorce demanded and granted unto Bothwell from his Lady,
(who afterward was married to the Earl Sutherland,) she was
sister to the Earl of Huntley. The ground of divorce was,
the parties being within the degrees prohibited, could not be
lawfully joyned: Next, because Bothwell was an adulterer,
the marriage was voyd. The bill of divorce was granted by
the Papisticall Court of the Archbishop of Saint Androis.
And here mark how they juggle in sacred things; for when
it pleaseth them, they untie the bond of marriage, as now,
and as we have seen in the First Book of this History. When
the Queen fell in distaste of the late King her husband, it
was proposed unto her to have divorce upon the same ground
from the King: To which, first ear was given, but after second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
thoughts, a bill of divorce was too tedious, (as we have now
said,) and could not be stayed for, therefore the King must be
dispatched.</p>

<div class="sidenote10">Note.</div>

<p>The Queen, when Bothwell had obtained by the Archbishop
a letter of divorce from his lawfull wife, sent a letter signed
with her own hand to Master John Craig, minister of Edinburgh,
commanding him to publish the band of matrimony
betwixt her and Bothwell. Master John Craig, the next sermon
day thereafter, declared in full congregation, that he had
received such a command, but in conscience he could not obey
it; the marriage was altogether unlawfull; and of that he
would declare the reasons to the parties, if he had audience of
them, otherwise he would make known his just reasons in the
hearing of the people. Immediately thereafter, Bothwell sends
for Master Craig to the Councell, where Master Craig told,
first, That by an Act of the Assembly, it was forbidden to
allow the marriage of any divorced for adultery: The divorce
of Bothwell from his lawfull wife, was by collusion, witnesse
the quick dispatch thereof; for it was sought and had within
ten days, and his contracting with the Queen instantly thereafter;
then his rapt of the Queen, and the guilt of the King's
death, which was confirmed by this marriage: withall, he desired
the Lords to stop the Queen<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> from that infamous marriage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
The Sunday after, he told publikely to the people,
what he had said to the Councell; and he took heaven and
earth to witnesse, that he detested that scandalous and infamous
marriage; and that he discharged his conscience unto
the Lords, who seemed unto him, as so many slaves, what by
flattery, what by silence, to give way to that abomination.
Upon this, he was called to the Councell again, and was reproved,
as if he had exceeded the bounds of his calling.
Whereunto he answered, That the bounds of his commission
was the word of God, right reason, and good laws, against
which he had said nothing; and by all these, offered to prove
this marriage to be scandalous and infamous. At this he was
stopped by Bothwell, and sent from the Councell. Notwithstanding
all this done and said by Master Craig, and the
opposition of many that wished well to the Queen, and were
jealous of her honour, the marriage went on, and they were
married the 15. of May. This makes good the Latino proverb,
<i>Mala nubunt mense Maio</i>; and a Bishop must bless the marriage:
The good Prelat was Bishop of Orkney:<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> If there be
a good work to be done, a Bishop must do it. Here mark the
difference betwixt this worthy minister Master Craig, and this
base Bishop.</p>

<p>The Earl of Athole, immediately after the murther of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
King, had retired home, waiting for the occasion to revenge
the King's death: But seeing this abominable marriage, he
went to Sterlin, where other honest Lords with him had a
meeting, and made a bond, to defend the young Prince from
the murtherers of his father; as already they had had one
plot to cut him off, which God in his mercy did prevent. The
Nobles that entred in this bond, were the Earls of Argyle,
Athole, Morton, Marr, and Glencarne; the Lords Lindsey and
Boyd. Argyle thereafter, seduced by some fair words, fell off;
and Boyd became a great factionary for Bothwell in all things.
The Queen, soon after the marriage, was advised to send
abroad an Ambassadour to acquaint her forraigne friends and
kindred; and this must be a Bishop: It is pity that any good
work should be done without a Bishop: was not this a worthy
employment for a pastor in God's Church.<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a></p>

<p>Bothwell seeing the bond made at Sterlin, causeth the
Queen to write to sundry of the Nobility. Divers repaired
unto her, where they found a bond tendred unto them, by
which they were to bind themselves to defend the Queen and
Bothwell. Some that were corrupt, did willingly subscribe;
others for fear did the same: and there was not one that went
to Court that did refuse, but the Earl of Murray; who refusing
absolutely to enter into a bond with Bothwell, said, It was not
the part of a good subject; yet since he had been made friends
with him some time before, he would keep his promise unto
the Queen; and to enter into a bond with the Queen, it was
needlesse and unfit, since he was to obey her in all lawfull and
just things. Upon this, he gat leave, although with great difficulty,
to go into France.</p>

<p>The Queen receives now Hamilton Archbishop of Saint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
Androis into favour since these changes; who was no less a
faithfull Councellor to her, then he was a good pastor of
Christ's flock; that is, he betrayed her, and disobeyed God.
With this a Proclamation comes out in favour of the poor
Protestants, whereby the Queen declares, That she will keep
and confirm all that she had promised at her arrivall into Scotland:
This was done to stop the people's mouthes; but all in
vain, for the people were universally against the abomination
of the Court.</p>

<p>Within few dayes, Bothwell and the Queen were raising men,
under pretext to go to the Borders to represse the robbers
there; but in effect to go to Sterlin, to have the Prince in
their custody, that they might dispose of him according to
their mind. Then a new Proclamation came out, That the
Queen hereafter would rule only by the advice of the Nobles
of the land, as her best predecessors had done. The Lords at
Sterlin, hearing of this plot, strives to prevent it, and to this
purpose they appointed with the Lord Hume, to besiege the
Castle of Borthwicke, where the Queen and Bothwell was:
But because the Earle of Athole did not come at the houre
appointed, they had not men enough to environ and compass
the Castle; so that Bothwell having notice given him of the
business, escaped to Dumbar, and the Queen after him, in
man's cloths. The Lords, failing of their designe at Borthwike
Castle, went to Edinburgh, whereof they made themselves
masters easily, having the affections of the people, notwithstanding
the Earl Huntley and the Archbishop of Saint
Androis perswasion to the contrary. These two, with their
associates, were constrained to retire to the Castle, where they
were received by Sir James Balfour, left there by Bothwell.</p>

<p>The twelfth of June, which was the next day following, the
Lords at Edinburgh caused to publish a proclamation, whereby
they declared, That the Earle Bothwell, who had been the
principall author, deviser, and actor of the cruell murther of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
the late King, had since laid hand upon the Queen's person,
and had her for the present in Dumbar in his power; and
finding her utterly destitute of all good counsell, had seduced
her to a dishonest and unlawfull marriage with himselfe; yea,
that now he was gathering forces, and stirring himself to get
the young Prince in his hands, that he might murther the
child, as he had murthered the father. This wicked man the
Nobles of the land resolved to withstand, and deliver the Queen
out of his bondage; wherefore they did charge all lieges within
the kingdom that could come to them, to be in readiness at
three hours warning to assist them (the Nobles) for the freeing
of the Queen from captivity, and bringing the said Earle Bothwell
to a legall triall, and condigne punishment for the aforesaid
murther and other crimes. All such that would not side
with the Lords were by this Proclamation commanded to
depart from Edinburgh within four hours, under the pain of
being accounted enemies, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this Proclamation, the people did not joyn
unto these Lords as was expected, for sundry of the Nobles
were adversaries to the business, others stood as neuters;
and withall, those that were convened together were not well
provided of armes and munition for exploits of warr; so that
they were even thinking to dissolve and leave off their enterprize
till another time, and had absolutely done so; but God
had ordained other wayes, as the event did shew, (if the Queen
and Bothwell could have had patience to stay at Dumbar for
three or four dayes without any stir;) but the Queen and Bothwell,
having gathered together about four or five thousand men,
trusting in their force, (the Queen being puft up by flatterers,)
set forth and marched towards Leith: Being come forward as
far as Glaidsmure, she caused publike Proclamation against the
aforesaid Lords, calling them a number of conspirators, and
that she now discerned their inward malice against her and
her husband, the Duke of Orkney, (for so now they called Bothwell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>)
After they had endeavoured to apprehend her and her
husband at Borthwick, and had made a seditious Proclamation,
under pretence of seeking the revenge of the King her late
husband, and to free her from captivity; giving out, that the
Duke her husband had a minde to invade the Prince her
sonne; all which was false, for the Duke her husband had
used all means to clear himself, both by a legall way and by
the offer of a combate to any that did accuse him, as they knew
well enough: As touching her captivity, she was in none, but
was in company with her husband, unto whom she was publikely
married in the view of the world, and many of the Nobles
had given their consent unto this her marriage: As for the
Prince her sonne, it was but a specious pretence to the treason
and rebellion against her their naturall Sovereign and her posteritie,
which they intended to overthrow; wherefore she declared
her self necessitated to take armes, hoping that all her
faithfull subjects would adhere unto her, and that those who
were already assembled with her, would with good hearts and
hands stand to her defence; and for the recompence of their
valour they should have the lands and goods of these unnaturall
rebels. After this Proclamation, the army went on, and the
Queen that night came to Seaton, where she lay.</p>

<p>About midnight the Lords of Edinburgh were advertised of
the Queen's approach, presently they took armes, and at the
sun rising they were at Musselburgh, where they refreshed
themselves with meat and rest. The Queen's camp was not
yet stirring. About mid-day the scouts that the Lords had
sent out, brought word that the enemie was marching towards
them; presently they put themselves in two batallias; the first
was conducted by the Earle Morton and the Lord Hume; the
second by the Earls Athole, Glencarne, the Lords Lindsay,
Ruthven, Semple, and Sanchar, with the Lairds Drumlanrick,
Tullibarden, Cesfoord, and Graunge, with divers others: their
number was almost as great as the Queen's, their men better,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
being many of them expert men, that I say nothing of the
cause. The Queen had gained a hill called Carbarry,<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> which
the Lords (by reason of the steepness of the ascent) could not
well come at; wherefore they wheeled about to get a more
convenient place to go to the hill, where the enemie was, and
to have the sunne behind them in the time of the fight. At
the first the Queen, seeing their thus going about, did imagine
they were fleeing away to Dalkeith, but when she saw them
come directly towards her, she found her self deceived.</p>

<p>The French Ambassador, seeing them ready to fight, strived
to take up the business, and having spoken with the Queen,
went to the Lords, telling them, that the Queen was disposed
to peace, and to forgive and pardon this insurrection: wherefore
it was very fit to spare blood, to agree in a peaceable way
The Earle of Morton (in the name of all the rest) answered,
That they had taken up armes, not against the Queen, but
against the murtherer of the King; whom if she would deliver
to be punished, or at least put from her company, she should
find a continuation of dutifull obedience by them, and all
other good subjects; otherwise no peace: besides, we are not
to ask pardon for any offence done by us. The Ambassador,
seeing their resolution to stand to the right of their cause,
withdrew, and went to Edinburgh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note how
God changeth
things
in a moment.</div>

<p>While the French Ambassadour was thus labouring for accommodation,
Bothwell came out of the camp (which was in
the trench that the Englishmen had left at their last being in
these places, as we have said in the former Books,) well mounted,
with a defie to any that would fight with him. James
Murray, brother to the Laird of Tullibardin, who before had
accepted of Bothwell's challenge, when he made the rodomontade
at Edinburgh, immediately after the King's death;
but then James Murray did not make known his name. Bothwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
refused to fight with James Murray,<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> alleadging he was not
his equall. Upon this the elder brother, William Murray, Laird
of Tullibardin, answered, That he would fight with him, as
being his better in estate, and in antiquitie of house many
degrees above him; yet Bothwell refused him, saying, That
he was not a Peer of the Kingdom, as he was; then sundry
Lords would have gone to fight with Bothwell; but the Lord
Lindsey namely, who said to the rest of the Lords and Gentlemen,
That he would take it as a singular favour of them, and
as a recompence of his service done to the State, if they would
suffer him to fight with the braggadocio. Bothwell seeing
that there was no more subterfuge nor excuse, under-hand made
the Queen to forbid him. After this challenge and answers,
Bothwell's complices and followers were very earnest to fight,
but others that had come only for the Queen's sake, became
little cold, saying, That Bothwell would do well to fight himself,
and spare the blood of divers gentlemen that were there.
Some counselled to delay the battell till the Hamiltons came,
whom they did expect. All this the Queen heard with anger;
and riding up and downe, burst out in teares, and said, They
were all cowards and traytors that would not fight. Immediately
after thus vapouring, the Queen, perceiving sundry to
leave her, she advised Bothwell to look unto himself, for she
said to him, she would render her selfe unto the Noble-men.<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a>
Upon this she sent for James Kirkaldie of Grange,<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> with whom
she kept discourse for a while, till that she was assured that
Bothwell was out of danger. Then she went to the Lords,
whom she did entertain with many fair words, telling them,
That it was neither fear, nor want of hope of victorie, that
made her come unto them, but a meer desire to spare shedding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
of innocent blood: withall she promised to be ruled and advised
by them. With this she was received with all respect: But
shortly after, declaring that she would go to the Hamiltons,
with promise to returne, they restrained her liberty, and brought
her along with them to Edinburgh at night: She was very slow
in marching, looking to be rescued by the Hamiltons; but in
vain. She lay that night in the Provest his house. The next
day, the Lords sent the Queen to the Castle that is within an
Isle of Lochlevin. Sir James Balfour, seeing the Queen committed,
and Bothwell consequently defeated, he capitulated with
the Lords for the deliverie of the Castle. Bothwell, finding
himselfe thus in disorder, sent a servant to Sir James Balfour,
to save a little silver cabinet which the Queen had given him.
Sir James Balfour delivers the cabinet to the messenger, and
under-hand giveth advice of it to the Lords. In this cabinet
had Bothwell kept the letters of privacy he had from the Queen:
Thus he kept her letters, to be an awe-bond upon her, in case
her affection should change. By the taking of this cabinet,
many particulars betwixt the Queen and Bothwell were clearly
discovered. These letters were after printed:<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> They were in
French, with some sonnets of her owne making.</p>

<p>[About this time the Earle Bothwell was declared by open
Proclamation not only the murtherer of the King, but also the
committer of it with his owne hand; and a thousand crownes
were offered to any man that would bring him in.]<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a></p>

<p>Few dayes after the commitment of the Queen, the Earl of
Glencarne with his domesticks went to the Chappell of Halyrud-house,
where he brake down the altars and the images:
which fact, as it did content the zealous Protestants, so it did
highly offend the Popishly affected. The Nobles, who had so
proceeded against Bothwell, and dealt so with the Queen, hearing
that the Hamiltons had a great number of men, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
drawn the Earls of Argyle and Huntley to their side, sent to
Hamilton, desiring those that were there to joyn with them,
for the redress of the disorders of the Kirk and State: But
the Hamiltons, thinking now they had a faire occasion fallen
unto them to have all again in their hands, and to dispose of
all according to their own mind, did refuse audience to the
message sent by the Lords.</p>

<p>Upon this, the Lords moved the Generall Assembly then
met in Edinburgh,<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> in the moneth of June, to write to the
Lords that either were actually declared for the Hamiltons or
were neuters: And so severall letters were directed to the Earls
of Argyle, Huntley, Cathnes, Rothesse, Crauford, and Menteith;
to the Lords Boyd, Drummond, Graham,<a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> Cathcart, Yester,
Fleming, Levingston, Seaton, Glams, Uchiltry, Gray, Olyphant,
Methven, Innermeth,<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> and Somervile, as also to divers other men
of note. Besides the letters of the Assembly, Commissioners
were sent from the Assembly to the Lords above-named; to
wit, John Knox, John Dowglas, John Row, and John Craig,
who had instructions conforme to the tenour of the letters, to
desire these Lords and others, to come to Edinburgh, and joyne
with the Lords there, for the setling of God's true worship in
the Church, and Policie reformed according to God's Word, a
maintenance for the Ministers, and support for the Poor: But
neither the Commissioners nor the letters did prevaile with
these men; they excused, that they could not repair to Edinburgh
with freedom, where there was so many armed men, and
a garrison so strong: But for the Church affairs they would
not be any wayes wanting, to do what lay in them.</p>

<p>The Lords at Edinburgh, seeing this, joyneth absolutely with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
the Assembly, (which had been prorogated to the 20. of July,<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a>
upon the occasion of these Letters and Commissioners aforesaid,)
and promiseth to make good all the Articles they thought fit
to resolve upon in the Assembly: But how they performed
their promises, God knows. Alwayes the Articles they agreed
upon were these:<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a></p>

<p>1. That the Acts of Parliament holden at Edinburgh the
24. of August 1560, touching Religion, and abolishing the
Pope's authoritie, should have the force of a publike law; and
consequently this Parliament defended as a lawfull Parliament,
and confirmed by the first Parliament that should be kept next.</p>

<p>2. That the Thirds of the Tythes, or any more reasonable
proportion of Benefices, should be allowed towards the maintenance
of the Ministery; and that there should be a charitable
course taken concerning the exacting of the tythes of the poor
labourers. [Moreover, that nothing should pass in Parliament
till the affaires of the Kirk be first considered, approven, and
established.]</p>

<p>3. That none should be received in the Universities, Colledges,
or Schooles, for instruction of the youth, but after due
tryall both of capacitie and probitie.</p>

<p>4. That all crimes and offences against God, should be
punished according to God's word; and that there should be a
law made there anent, at the first Parliament to be holden.</p>

<p>5. As for the horrible murther of the late King, husband to
the Queen, which was so haynous before God and man, all true
professors, in whatsoever rank or condition, did promise to
strive that all persons should be brought to condigne punishment,
who are found guilty of the same crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>6. They all promised to protect the young Prince against
all violence, lest he should be murthered as his father was;
and that the Prince should be committed to the care of four
wise and godly men, that by a good education, he might be
fitted for that high calling he was to execute one day.</p>

<p>7. The Nobles, Barons, and others, doth promise to beat
down and abolish Popery, Idolatry, and Superstition, with any
thing that may contribute unto it; as also to set up and further
the true worship of God, his government, the Church, and
all that may concern the purity of Religion and life; and for
this to convene and take arms, if need require.</p>

<p>8. That all Princes and Kings hereafter in this Realm, before
their Coronation, shall take oath to maintain the true Religion
now professed in the Church of Scotland, and suppress
all things contrary to it, and that are not agreeing with it.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>To these Articles<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> subscribed the Earls of Morton, Glencarne,
and Marr, the Lords Hume, Ruthven, Sanchar, Lindsey, Grame,
Innermeth, and Uchiltrie, with many other Barons, besides
the Commissioners of the Burroughs.</p>

<p>This being agreed upon, the Assembly dissolved. Thereafter
the Lords Lindsay and Ruthven were sent to Lochlevin
to the Queen, to present unto her two writs; the one contained
a renunciation of the Crowne and Royall dignitie in favour of
the Prince her son; with a Commission to invest him into the
Kingdome, according to the manner accustomed: which after
some reluctancy, with tears, she subscribed<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> by the advice of
the Earle of Athole, who had sent to her; and of Secretary
Lethington, who had sent to her Robert Melvill<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> for that purpose:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
So there was a procuration given to the Lords Lindsey
and Ruthven, by the Queen, to give up and resign the rule of
the Realm, in presence of the States.</p>

<p>The second writ was, To ordain the Earle of Murray Regent
during the Prince's minority, if he would accept the charge:
And in case he refused [to accept the said office upon his single
person, that he with] the Duke Chattelarault, the Earles of
Lenox, Argyle, Athole, Morton, Glencarne, and Marr, should
govern conjunctly.</p>

<p>These writs were published the 29. of July 1567, at the
Market Crosse of Edinburgh. Then at Sterlin was the Prince
crowned King, where John Knox made the sermon. The Earle
Morton and the Lord Hume took the oath for the King, that
he should constantly live in the profession of the true Religion,
and maintain it; and that he should govern the Kingdom according
to [the] law thereof, and doe justice equally to all.</p>

<p>In the beginning of August, the Earle Murray being sent
for, cometh home;<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> in all haste he visits the Queen at Lochlevin,
strives to draw the Lords that had taken part with the
Hamiltons, or were neuters, to joyne with those that had bound
themselves to stand for the King's authoritie: He was very
earnest with divers, by reason of their old friendship, but to
little purpose. The twentie of August, he received his Regency,
after mature and ripe deliberation, at the desire of the Queen,
and Lords that were for the King, and so was publikely proclaimed
Regent, and obedience showed unto him by all that
stood for the young King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>A few particulars respecting <span class="smcap">David Buchanan</span>, the Editor of Knox's
History, may be subjoined to the preceding collations. The author
of the Genealogical Account of the Buchanans, in 1723, states that
he was the second son of William [John] Buchanan of Arnpryor,
an ancient family in the parish of Kippen, Stirlingshire. John
Buchanan, eldest son of the late John Buchanan of Arnpryor, had
a charter of the lands of Arnpryor, 3d May 1598; and having sold
the estate of Arnpryor to Sir John Buchanan of Buchanan, he settled
in Ireland. He was killed by the Irish rebels in 1641. "There was a
younger brother, Captain William, a gentleman of very much courage,
and of the greatest art and dexterity in managing a sword of any
of his time;" and two instances of his prowess are related in that
work, (p. 61.)</p>

<p>David Buchanan, whom the above author describes us "a gentleman
of great learning, who flourished in the latter part of the reign
of James the Sixth," was born towards the close of the sixteenth century,
probably about the year 1592. He appears to have prosecuted
his studies during part of the usual course in St. Leonard's College,
St. Andrews, where he matriculated or became an Intrant in the
spring of 1610. It has not been ascertained at what University he
took his degree of Master of Arts; or, indeed, any particulars of his
mode of life for a period of upwards of twenty years. According to
his own words, he must have spent many years on the Continent, and
is not improbable he may have filled a Professor's chair in one of
the Protestant Colleges in France. In 1636, he published a learned
work under this title: "Historia Animæ Humanæ, Auctore Davide
Buchanano, Scoto. (No place of printing,) <small>M.DC.XXXVI.</small>" Small 8vo.
This was followed by a similar treatise in French, entitled "Histoire
de la Conscience, <small>M.DC.XXXVIII.</small>" 12mo.</p>

<p>From a passage in Milton already referred to, (vol. i. p. xlii,) it
would seem as if the publication of Buchanan's edition of Knox's
History of the Reformation had been delayed by the Censor of the
Press in 1644. The preceding collations, (for which, and also for
those in the next Article of this Appendix, I am indebted to the unwearied
care and accuracy of my venerable friend, <span class="smcap">Mr. Meek</span>,) serve
to show the actual liberties Buchanan has taken with the text. Frequent
instances of palpable blunders will be observed, as if the
Editor himself had not corrected the proof-sheets. In the marginal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
notes he has added various allusions to his own times; and the interpolations
he has introduced into the text are remarkable, chiefly
on account of the anachronisms; and as these have been laid hold of,
in some measure, to discredit the authenticity of the original work,
it has thus been rendered necessary to take so much pains in collating
his editions with the genuine text. In regard to passages
omitted, or expressions modified and softened, it is highly probable
that this may have proceeded from the Licenser of the Press in
London, rather than Buchanan himself; and whether similar or even
greater liberties may have been taken with Book Fifth, we have
unfortunately no means of ascertaining.</p>

<p>In the following year Buchanan published at London a little
volume, which, with another tract printed in 1646, involved him in
some trouble. Baillie, who was personally acquainted with him, in
a letter to Spang, who was then Minister of Campvere in Zealand,
in June 1645, speaks of "your cousigne, Mr. David Buchanan, as
a most honest and worthy man." In a subsequent letter, dated 24th
April 1646, he says, it was thought necessary that the Papers given
into Parliament by the Scottish Commissioners should be printed;
and "among others, Mr. <span class="smcap">David Buchanan</span>, <i>a most sincere and zealous
gentleman, who has done both in write and print, here</i> (in London) <i>and
over-sea, many singular services to this Parliament, to his Nation, and to
the whole Cause</i>; ... hazarded to print them with a Preface of his
own, and an introduction, both very harmless and consonant to the
three following papers which we had given in to both Houses."
Baillie further adds, that within two or three days, 3000 or 4000
copies were sold; and that this having excited the indignation of
"our small friends," both Houses of Parliament agreed in ordering
the books to be burnt by the hands of the hangman, and in denouncing
the publisher, Mr. Buchanan, as an incendiary. (Baillie's Letters
and Journals, vol. ii. p. 367.) The two publications thus referred
to were,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Truth its Manifest; or a short and true Relation of divers main
Passages of things, (in some whereof the <i>Scots</i> are particularly concerned,)
from the very first beginning of these unhappy Troubles to
this day. Published by Authority. London, printed in the year
1645." 12mo, pp. xviii., 142.</p>

<p>"Some Papers of the Commissioners of Scotland, given in lately
to the Houses of Parliament, concerning the Propositions of Peace.
London, printed for Robert Bostock, &amp;c., April 11, 1646." 4to,
pp. 26.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>The following extracts from the Journals of the House of Commons
confirm Baillie's statements:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the 10th April 1646, the House of Commons "Ordered, &amp;c.,
That the Report concerning a Book, entituled, 'Truth's Manifest,' be
made on Monday morning," &amp;c. (Journals, vol. iv. p. 505.)</p>

<p>"Die Lunæ, 13<sup>o</sup> Aprilis 1646. Mr. Lisle reports the state of the
business concerning the printed book, intituled, 'Truth's Manifest;'
read many passages out of it; and said, The Author of it was one
Mr. Buchanan; who delivered one of the said books to the Committee,
and did avow it to be his writing.</p>

<p>"Resolved, &amp;c., That Mr. David Buchanan be forthwith sent for,
as a Delinquent, by the Serjeant at Arms attending on this House;
and brought to the Bar to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>"Resolved, &amp;c., That the book intituled, 'Truth's Manifest,' does
contain in it many matters false and scandalous; and they do <i>Order</i>,
That the said book be forthwith burnt by the hands of the common
hangman." (ib. p. 507.)</p>

<p>On the same day, the House also declared, that the book entituled,
"Some Papers of the Commissioners of Scotland, given in lately to
the Houses of Parliament, concerning the Propositions of Pence, doth
contain in it matters scandalous and false," &amp;c., and was Ordered
to be burnt, &amp;c. (ib. p. 507.) But this declaration was so far modified
on the 20th April, in restricting the sentence simply to the
Editor's Epistle and Tract, "The State of the Question concerning
the Propositions of Peace," (which are prefixed by the Editor, on
three leaves, after the title page.) (ib. p. 517.)</p>

<p>During the latter period of his life, Buchanan was engaged with
Gordon of Straloch in illustrating the topography and antiquities of
his native country, in connexion with the great Atlas of Scotland,
which was published in Holland, by Bleau, in 1654. His papers
afterwards fell into the hands of Sir Robert Sibbald, by whom some
of them were printed. Two MS. works, "De Scriptoribus Scotis,"
the one dated 1627, and attributed to Buchanan, were printed for the
Members of the Bannatyne Club, with a learned Preface by the
Editor, Dr. Irving, in 1837.</p>

<p>From his Confirmed Testament, it appears that "Mr. David
Buchanan," who died at Edinburgh before the end of August 1652,
on the 19th of that month, had nominated "his loving brother,
Mr. William Buchanan," his only executor. Whether "Captain
William," above mentioned as David's brother, should be identified
with this "Mr. William Buchanan," may be left to conjecture.</p>

<h2>No. II.</h2>

<h3>ON SPOTTISWOOD'S EDITION OF THE FIRST BOOK OF DISCIPLINE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is well known that Queen Mary, both in France and after her
return to this country, refused to ratify the Proceedings of the <span class="smcap">Parliament</span>
which met at Edinburgh in August 1560; and its Acts, were
not included in the authorized collection of the public statutes. In
order to obviate this legal want of the royal sanction, it was judged
expedient that the <span class="smcap">Confession of Faith</span>, and some special Acts,
should be renewed in the first Parliament of James the Sixth, during
the regency of the Earl of Murray, in December 1567. It was proposed
to have inserted in this Appendix a list of the Members and
some passages relating to the proceedings of that Parliament, along
with an account of the early editions of the Confession of Faith,
1560; and some notes respecting the First Book of Discipline. Want
of space has rendered it necessary to omit these notices; but another
opportunity may be afforded of introducing them in a subsequent
volume.</p>

<p>It is also well known that the selfish rapacity of some of the
Nobility who had supported the Reformed doctrines, and had obtained
possession of Church-lands and property, prevented the Policy
of the Kirk from being established according to the plan drawn
up by Knox and his brethren. But the <span class="smcap">First Book of Discipline</span>
must always be regarded as an important work to illustrate
the form of Church government and discipline submitted for approval
by our early Reformers; and it is now presented to the
Reader in a much more perfect and authentic form than it has ever
appeared.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The following notes, selected from a careful collation of the Book
of Discipline, with the copy inserted by Spottiswood in his History
of the Church, will prove how very little reliance can be
placed on the Archbishop's assertion of his having given it "word
by word." As the omissions and emendations referred to might
have been inside by the Editor in 1655, (see page 181, note 5,)
the new edition, printing for the Spottiswoode Society, (edited by
Bishop Russell, and collated with the author's original MS.,) has
been employed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Page 183-184, Spottiswood omits the whole of the Preface, and
introduces the Book of Discipline with the short paragraph
already quoted at page 181, note 5. There is a slight variation
in the new edit. (p. 331,) reading, "I <i>have</i> thought meet,
word by word, to insert the same," &amp;c.</p>

<p class="hanging">187, There are several omissions in this page; for instance, in
line 7, the words "devysed by men;" various words in lines
15 to 22; and nearly the whole of lines 24 to 26.</p>

<p class="hanging">188, lines 21, 22, altered; and lines 24 to 29 abridged.</p>

<p class="hanging">189, l. 10, omits "cursed" as applied to "Papistrie."</p>

<p class="hanging">190, l. 12, reads, "in open audience of his flock, he may preach and

<p class="hanging">192, l. 4 to 6, "and so ... of the Kirk," omitted.</p>

<p class="hanging">193, l. 4 to 19, varied and abridged; and lines 25, 26, read, "The
Ministers were publicly admitted."</p>

<p class="hanging">195, l. 14, altered; and lines 21 to 27, "And gif," &amp;c., omitted. The
next head, "For Readeris," is partially abridged.</p>

<p class="hanging">198, l. 1, the words, "at the discretion of the congregation," omitted.</p>

<p class="hanging">199, l. 3, the words, "in Goddis presence we witness," omitted;
and lines 7 to 15 amended.</p>

<p class="hanging">200, l. 12 to 14, part of the sentence omitted; and the paragraph
that follows, "Restis yit," &amp;c. concerning provision for the poor,
and the teachers of youth, contracted to about one-third.</p>

<p class="hanging">201 to 203, Under the head, "Off the Superintendents," the original
which here consists of 38 lines, is contracted by Spottiswood
to 6 lines.</p>

<p class="hanging">204, l. 11, "to leave as your idill Bischopis," changed to "to live
idle as the Bishops."</p>

<p class="hanging">205, The third head, "Of the Election of Superintendentis," appears
as if re-written and abridged; l. 18, reads, "we think it sufficient
that the Council nominate;" and lines 22 to 25 omitted.</p>

<p class="hanging">207, l. 6 to 12, "Yff the Ministeris," &amp;c., omitted.</p>

<p class="hanging">208, l. 16 to 26, "Of one thing, in the end," &amp;c., omitted.</p>

<p class="hanging">208, 209, "For the Schollis;" the introductory paragraph omitted,
and the next 14 lines contracted to 5 lines.</p>

<p class="hanging">214, l. 24, reads, "New Testament, and shall finish his course the
same year. And in," &amp;c.</p>

<p class="hanging">221, l. 2 to 12, "not doubting," &amp;c., omitted. Under the "Sext
Heid," except the first sentence, the whole of the first paragraph,
"But befoir we enter," &amp;c., is omitted.</p>

<p class="hanging">222, l. 4 to 9, "We dar not flatter," &amp;c., omitted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging">223, l. 27, &amp;c. "Your Honouris," &amp;c.; the whole of this paragraph
omitted.</p>

<p class="hanging">225, l. 13, The "Additio" is not found in Spottiswood.</p>

<p class="hanging">226, l. 23, "Yf this Ordour," &amp;c., to the end of the paragraph,
omitted.</p>

<p class="hanging">227, The second paragraph, "But becaus this accursit Papistrie,"
&amp;c., omitted.</p>

<p class="hanging">230, l. 21 to 23, Spottiswood reads, "This sentence, as being the most
heavy censure which can be inflicted by the Church, ought not
to be rashly used but for grave causes, and due process of time
kept, but being pronounced, ought with all severity to be maintained,

<p>A great many lesser variations, consisting of words omitted, sentences

would have served any useful purpose. The above may suffice to
satisfy any impartial reader, who desires in this <span class="smcap">Form of Policy</span>
"to see what were the grounds laid down at first for the government

<h3>FUNERALS OF MARY OF GUISE, QUEEN REGENT OF SCOTLAND.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Marie De Lorraine</span>, daughter of Claude Duke of Guise, was
born 22d November 1515. On the 4th August 1534, she was married
to Louis of Orleans, Duke de Longueville; and after his death,
in 1538, she became the second wife of James the Fifth, King of
Scotland. (See vol. i. p. 61, note 6.) In this place it was proposed
to collect merely a few notices respecting her death and funerals.</p>

<p>In the present volume, at page 71, Knox has given an account of
the Queen's death, which took place in the Castle of Edinburgh&mdash;he
says on the 9th June 1560. Dr. Robertson following Bishop Lesley,
and other early authorities, says it was on the 10th; while according
to Chalmers, and later writers, it happened on the 11th June. In
the Diurnal of Occurrents the time is very precisely stated, yet it so
happens that either the 10th or the 11th might be assigned for the
date. The passage stands thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Upoun the tent day of Junij, the yeir foirsaid (1560,) Marie
Quene Dowriare and Regent of this Realme, <i>at 12 houris at evin</i>, deceissit
in the Castell of Edinburgh, and maid the Erie of Merchell,
and Schir Johne Campbell of Lundy, knycht, hir executouris in Scotland."
(p. 59; see also p. 276 of the same work.) This would seem to
fix the 10th; but in the grant to Seigneour Francis, referred to in a note,
page 507, the 11th of June was reckoned as the day of the Queen's
decease. Sir William Cecil and Dr. Nicholas Wotton, in a letter
written on the 17th June, intimate their having heard of the Queen's
death, when they were on their way from Berwick; and in a subsequent
letter from Edinburgh, dated the 19th June, they say, "The
xith of this monethe, the Quene Dowagier dyed here at Edenboroughe,
as we understande of a dropsie; by whose deathe the Nobilitie of
Scotlande be entred into greater boldness, for mayntenaunce of their
quarrell, then before they durst shew." (Lodge's Illustrations, vol. i.
p. 329.) In the Treasurer's Accounts of that month are the following
entries:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Treasury">
<tr><td align="left">"Item, to Johne Weir pewtterar, for ane wobe of leid weiand (blank) stanis, to be ane sepulture to inclose the Quenis Grace in.</td><td align="right">iiij lb. xv s.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">"Item, to the said Johne for sowdane of the said wobe of leid,</td><td align="right">xxxij s.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>After these items, there follows a list of sums paid to the attendants,
servants, and other persons connected with the Queen's household; in
all 97, chiefly French, amounting to £1352, 8s.</p>

<p>Bishop Lesley, in noticing the Queen's death, says, "Hir bodie
thaireftir was carried to France in ane ship, to the Abbey of Feckin
in Normandie." (History, p. 289.) Knox, at page 160, speaks of
her burial having been deferred, and that "lappet in a cope of leid,"
her body lay in the Castle of Edinburgh till the 19th October,
"quhan sche by pynouris was caryed to a schip, and sa caryed to
France." Another authority asserts, that it was not till the spring
following that her body was removed from Edinburgh.</p>

<p>"Upoun the xvj day of the said moneth of March, [1560-1] at
xij houris in the nycht, the corpes of vmquhile Marie Quene Douriare
of Scotland and Regent, was convoyit secretlie furth of the Castell of
Edinburgh, and put in ane schip in Leith, and convoyit thairfra to
France, be Mr. Archibald Crawfurd person of Eiglishame; quhair
sho was honourablie buryit." (Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 282.)</p>

<p>In mentioning the Queen Regent's funerals, Bishop Lesley, in his
Latin History, is somewhat more circumstantial, by adding, that after
reaching the sea-port of Fécamp in Normandy, and lying for a time
in the Monastery, the body was finally removed to Rheims. His
words are,&mdash;" Ejus autem corpus in Galliam postea transvectum primum
ad Monasterium Feckamense, quod in Normania est, deinde
ad c&oelig;nobium S. Petri Rhemis in Campania, cui Soror ipsius pie tunc
præerat, delatum, honorifice condebatur." (De Rebus gestis Scotorum,
p. 569.)</p>

<p>Throckmorton also, in a letter addressed to Queen Elizabeth from
Paris, 13th July 1561, says, "The said Queen of Scotland's determination
to go home continues still: <i>She goeth shortly from Court to Fescamp,
in Normandy, there to make her Mother's funerals and burial</i>, and
from thence to Calais, there to embark." (Tytler's History, vol. vi.
p. 398.)</p>

<p>After the funeral ceremonies at Fécamp, the Queen's body was
transported to the city of Rheims, and interred in the Church of the
Abbey or Convent of Saint-Pierre-les-Dames, of which her sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
Renée de Lorraine was Abbess. This younger daughter of Claude
de Lorraine, first Duke of Guise, was born in 1522. She became
Abbess in 1546, and survived till the 3d of April 1602, when she
was interred beside her sister the Queen of Scotland. There was a
handsome marble monument erected in the choir of the church; but
the Abbey itself was in a great measure destroyed during the excesses
of the French Revolution in 1792. The monument was adorned
with a full length figure in bronze of the Queen in royal apparel,
holding the sword and the rod of justice, "tenant le sceptre et la
main de justice." (Anselme, Hist. Genealogique, tome iii. p. 492.)</p>

<h3>NOTICES OF JOHN BLACK, A DOMINICAN FRIAR.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Friar John Black</span>, of the Dominican Order, is celebrated by
Lesley, Dempster, and other Roman Catholic writers, for his learning
and exertions on behalf of the orthodox faith. In August 1559, the
Queen Regent came from Dunbar to Edinburgh, and having taken
possession of Holyrood House, it is stated, that Archbishop Hamilton,
"upon a day, past to the pulpit in the Abbay," and after displaying
"a little of his superstition, he declared he had not bene weill
exercised in that profession, (<i>i.e.</i> of preaching,) therefore desyred the
auditors to hold him excused. In the meantyme he showed unto
them that there was a learned man, meaning Fryer Blacke, who was
to come immediately after him into the pulpitt, who would declare
unto them the truth; and therefore desyred them to lett him cease."
(Hist. of the Estate of Scotland, Wodrow Miscellany, vol. i. p. 67.)</p>

<p>Bishop Lesley mentions a public disputation between Friar Black
and John Willock, at Edinburgh, in the summer of 1561, which lasted
for two days. As usual, however, in all such controversial disputes,
"<i>in the ende, nothing was agreit</i>." (Hist. p. 295. See also Leslæus de
Rebus Gestis Scotorum, p. 577, Romæ, 1578, 4to; and Sir James
Balfour's Annals, Works, vol. i. p. 235.) Under the year 1560,
(see this vol. p. 68,) Knox mentions Friar Black as performing
Mass when the Queen Regent was in the Castle of Edinburgh,
notwithstanding that she was aware of his licentious conduct. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
years later the Town Council of Edinburgh having apprehended and
confined Friar Black "for manifest adultery," Queen Mary addressed
the following letter to the Provost, Baillies, &amp;c., of Edinburgh, commanding
them to deliver the said Friar to the Captain of the Castle,
to remain there till he should be brought to trial:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Provest, Baillies, and Counsale of Edinburgh</span>,&mdash;It is oure
Will, and we charge zow, that incontinent efter the sicht heirof, ze
deliver Freir Johne Black to the Capitane, Constabill, and Keiparis of
oure Castell of Edinburgh, till be keipit thairintill surelie, unto sic
tyme as we haue ordanyt for the triell of his offences before oure Justice-Generale
or his Deputtis; and this on na wayis ze leaf undone,
as ze will ansuer to ws thairupoun. At Sanct Androis, the 11th of
April 1562.</p>

<p class="signature">
(<i>Sequitur subscriptio</i>,) "<span class="smcap">Marie R.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The records of criminal proceedings furnish no evidence of the
Friar having ever been brought to trial; but this warrant, no doubt,
saved him from the punishment which the Town Council at this time
had adjudged to all fornicators, to be ducked in the North Loch. (See
Maitland's Hist. of Edinb. p. 25.)</p>

<p>On the 12th February 1565, Andro Armestrang, and three other
burgesses of Edinburgh, were brought to trial, "delatit of the hurting
and wounding of Freir Johne Blak, betwix his schulderis, to the effusione
of his blude, upon the fyft day of Januar last bypast, betwix
aucht and nyne houris at evin, in the Cowgait, betwix Nwyderis
Wynd and the Freir Wynd." (Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, vol. i. pp.
475*, 476*.) From another authority, mentioned below, it would
seem that the Friar was killed during the fray in Holyrood, on the
same night when Riccio was murdered.</p>

<p>The transcriber of MS. W, of Knox's History, has introduced some
lines, playing upon the Friar's name, "because he was borne in the <i>Blak</i>
Freirs in Edinburgh, and was a man of <i>Blak</i> personage, called <i>Blak</i> to
his name, and one of the Ordour of <i>Blak</i> Friers;" and in the margin
of the MS. he says, "This was added be me, Tho. Wood, quhilk I
heard, thocht not mentioned by Mr. Knox." Mr. Sharpe, who says,
"this copy of verses affords an excellent (?) specimen of the satirical
poetry of the Reformers," has inserted the lines, in a note to Kirkton's
History of the Church, p. 10, Edinb. 1817, 4to.</p>

<p>In a MS. volume of Calderwood's History, written in the year
1636, we find introduced, as "A description of the Queen's Black
Chaplane," a somewhat different version of the lines referred to:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>"Master Knox relateth, that the Queen Regent herself had a little
before deprehended the said Frier Black with his harlot in the
chappel. But whoordoome and idolatrie agrie weill together. This
Frier Black was Black in a threefold consideration, first in respect of
his Order, for he was a Black Frier by profession; secondlie in respect
of his Surname; thirdlie in respect of his Black workes. Wherupon
these black verses following wer made as a black trumpet to
blaze furth all his blacknesses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"A certane Black Frier, weill surnamed Black,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And not nicknam'd: for Black wer all his workes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a black houre borne, in all Mack deedes frack;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And of his black craft one of the blackest Clerks;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Black was his soule to shoote at such black markes;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Frier Black, Black Frier, Black was his vocation."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>It may be considered more important to notice, that Black had
been promoted by Archbishop Hamilton, to the place of Second
Master in St. Mary's College, St. Andrews. This fact, not elsewhere
recorded, appears from the following grant, in the Register of Presentations
to Benefices:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our Soverane Lord, &amp;c., ordanis this letter under the Previe Seill,
ratifiand and perpetualie confirmand the gift and provisioun maid and
grantit be John Archebishop of Sanct Androis, foundar and erectar
of our Lady College, within the citie of Sanct Androis, to Maister
Robert Hamiltoun, then Third Maister of the said College <i>of the
Secund place and Maister thairof</i>, usit to be possessit be ane theologe
(the lyke quhairof he is) <i>vacand be deceis of Johne Black, Blackfriar</i>,

at Saint Androis the last day of Maij 1569." (Register of
Presentation to Benefices, vol. i. fol. 25.)</p>

<p>Dempster celebrates Black (<i>præclarus Christi miles</i>) for his eloquence
and opposition to heresy, and for having sealed his constant profession
of the faith with his blood. (Hist. Ecclesiastica Gentis Scotorum,
p. 85.) This alludes to the fatal termination of the Friar's career,
not on the 7th of January 1562, for which he quotes Lesley, p. 577,
but on the 8th March 1565-6, when he was slain on the night of
David Riccio's murder, in Holyrood House. It is singular that no
notice of this should occur in our own historical writers. But Parkhurst,
Bishop of Norwich, in a letter to Buttinger, giving him a summary
of passing events, dated 21st August 1566, after noticing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
murder of "Signor David, skilled in necromancy, and in great favour
with the Queen of Scots," mentions that Black, a Dominican Friar,
held in great estimation among the Papists, was also killed that night.
But even this grave prelate cannot restrain his humour in reference
to the Friar's name; his words are: "Fraterculus quidam, nomine
Blacke (niger, <i>Swartz</i>,) Papistarum antesignanus, eodem tempore in
Aula occiditur.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Sic Niger hic Nebulo, nigra quoque morte peremptus,<br /></span>

<p>This letter, first published by Burnet, (Hist. Reform., vol. iii. App.,
p. 360,) is included in the collection of Zürich Letters, published by
the Parker Society, p. 99. London, 1842, 8vo. The translator thus
renders the above distich:&mdash;</p>

<h3>NOTICES OF DAVID RICCIO.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> appears somewhat doubtful whether Knox contemplated giving
any detailed account of Riccio's life: compare vol. i. p. 235, and vol. ii.
p. 422. If so, it would probably not have been so much a narrative
of his private history, as an exposure of the influence which he
seems to have exerted in public affairs, tending to the overthrow of
the Reformed Religion. Although we cannot attribute to Knox the
passages in the Fifth Book which relate the murder of Riccio, yet
some detached notices exhibiting his progressive advancement at the
Scotish Court, chiefly derived from the Public Records, may not be
considered as out of place in this Appendix.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David Riccio</span>, a native of Pancalieri, in Piedmont, was born about
the year 1534, and was first in the service of the Archbishop of
Turin. In December 1561, the Marquis de Morette, the Ambassador
of Savoy, arrived in Scotland to congratulate Queen Mary on her
return to her native kingdom. It was in the suite of the Marquis that
Riccio, when about twenty-eight years of age, came to this country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
in quality of Secretary. (Labanoff, Recueil des Lettres de Marie
Stuart, Reine d'Ecosse, vol. i. p. 120, vol. vii. pp. 65, 86.) His knowledge
of the French and Italian languages, and his skill in music,
recommended him to the Queen's notice, and led to his permanent
residence in Scotland as "virlat," "chalmer-cheild," or one of the
valets of her chamber. In the Treasurer's Accounts in the early
part of the year 1562, we find the following payments:&mdash;</p>

<p>
1561-2.&mdash;"Item, the said day, (viij day of Januar,) be the Quenis
Grace precept to David Ritio, virlat in the Quenis Grace chalmer,</p>
<p class="signature">1. lib. (£50.)
</p>

<p>1562.&mdash;"Item, the xvj day of Aprile, be the Quenis Grace precept
to David Ritio, Italiane, chalmer-cheild, as his acquittance schawin
vpoun compt beris,</p>

<p class="signature">xv. lib."
</p>
<p>
These payments seem to have been additions to the annual pension
granted to him by the Queen. In the "Compt of the Collector Generall
of the Thirds of Benefices," for the year 1561, and rendered
18th February 1563-4, we find among the pensions paid, the following
entry:&mdash;"And of the soume of threscoir fivetene pundis, pait be
the Comptare to <span class="smcap">David Rycheo</span>, Italiane, vallet of the chalmer, for
his zeirlie pensioun, granted to him be the Quenis Majestie, of the zeir
compted, as hir Hienes letters vnder hir subscriptioun, and the said
Davidis acquittance schawin and producit upoun compt proportis,
</p>
<p class="signature">lxxv. lib."
</p>

<p>In 1564, Riccio's salary was £80, paid quarterly; and in December
that year, he was nominated French Secretary to the Queen, in
place of Raulet. (Randolph's Letter to Cecil, 3d December 1564,
Keith's Hist., vol. ii. p. 259; and Labanoff, vol. i. p. 248.) In the
Treasurer's Accounts in August 1565, there are numerous payments
made "to David Riccio Secretar," for articles of furniture, dress, &amp;c.,
"be the King and Quenis Graces precept," chiefly for the use of
"the Kingis Grace." He had been an active promoter of the Queen's
marriage with Darnley, which may have contributed to increase his
interest at Court. Randolph, in a letter to Cecil, dated 3d June
1565, uses this strong language:&mdash;" David now worketh all, and is
only governor to the King and his family; <i>great is his pride, and his
words intolerable</i>. People have small joy in this new master, and find
nothing but that God must either send him a short end, or them a
miserable life. Tho dangers to those he now hateth are great, <i>and
either he must be taken away, or they find some support, that what he intendeth
to others may fall upon himself</i>." (Keith's Hist., vol. ii. p. 291.)
It has been said that he was appointed Keeper of the Great Seal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
about this time. This undoubtedly is a mistake: see vol. i. p. 446.
But the influence he had obtained, and the prospect that when the
Parliament assembled he might prevail upon the Queen to proceed
against the Earl of Murray and the chief Protestants, in connexion
with the foolish jealousy of her husband, gave rise to that conspiracy
which terminated in Riccio's murder&mdash;one of those deeds which disgrace
the history of this country.</p>

<p>Referring again to the Treasurer's Accounts, one or two other entries
may be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Item, be the Quenis grace command, the last of Januar [1565-6,]
to David Riccio, for reparatione of his chalmer, as his acquittance
schawin upoun compt beris,</p>
<p class="signature">ij<sup>c</sup> lib. (£200.)"
</p>

<p>On the last of February he received, on the Queen's account,
£2000 in part payment of 10,000 merks, for "the dewitie of the
Cunzehouse." And after his death, we find,</p>

<p>
"Item, the xxix day of Maij (1566) to ane boy passand of Edinburgh
with letters of our Soueranis, to be deliverit to Robert Commendator
of Halierudhouse, to command and charge all and sindrie
personis, intrometteris, havaris, withhalderis, and detenaris of the
horssis quhatsumevir partening to umquhill <span class="smcap">David Riccio</span>, <i>Secretar</i>,
to be deliverit to the said Commendator,</p>
<p class="signature">ix s."
</p>

<p>The Collection of Queen Mary's Letters, formed with almost unexampled
care and zeal by the Prince Alexander Labanoff, includes
two long and interesting dispatches in Italian, (one without date, the
other, 8th October 1566,) addressed to Cosmo Duke of Tuscany,
which furnish various particulars both relating to Riccio's history and
the events preceding his murder, on the evening of Saturday the 9th
March 1565-6. "Ah povero Davit, mio buono et fedel servitore,
Dio habbi misericordia di vostra anima!" (Recueil, &amp;c., vol. vii.
pp. 65, 86, 93.)</p>

<p>Calderwood repeats what George Buchanan states in his History
regarding Riccio's funeral: "After the flight of the Noblemen from
Edinburgh, the Queen caused to take up in the night Seigneur Davie
his corps, which had been buried before the Abbey kirk doore, and
lay it near to Queene Magdalene; which ministered no small occasioun
to the people of bad constructions." (History, vol. ii. p. 316.)</p>

<p>"A Relation of the Death of David Rizzi, chief favourite of
Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland; who was killed in the apartment
of the said Queen on the 9th March 1565. Written by the Lord
Ruthen, one of the principal persons concerned in that action," was
printed at London 1699, 8vo, and has been several times reprinted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
One of these editions, forming part of a volume entitled, "Miscellanea
Antiqua Anglicana," London, 1815, 4to, is accompanied with a portrait
of Riccio: It has much the look of an original by Zucchero,
and is "painted on a small circular pannel; and on the back are
rudely cut into the wood the name <i>Davit Rixio</i>, and the date 1564."</p>

<h3>THE ABBOTS OF CULROSS AND LINDORES IN 1560.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is often impossible to identify persons at an early period who held
high ecclesiastical appointments, from only their baptismal names and
designations being given in deeds and the public records. But it is
singular that any difficulty should have been experienced in regard to
persons who flourished so late as the middle of the 16th century.
Among the dignified clergy who were present at the condemnation of
Sir John Borthwick for heresy, in May 1540, we find the names of
William Commendator of Culross, and John Abbot of Lindores.
Both of these individuals took their seats as Lords of Session, on
the Spiritual side, 5th November 1544; they had also a seat in Parliament;
and both of them having joined the Reformers, were
present when the Confession of Faith was ratified and approved in
August 1560.</p>


<p class="center">I. <span class="smcap">William Commendator of Culross, 1539-1564.</span></p>

<p>I have two deeds dated in 1539-40, and 1541, granted by "William
Commendator and Usufructuar of Culross, and John be the
permission of God Abbot of that ilk, and Convent of the samyn,"
signed, "<span class="smcap">Villelmus</span> Commendatarius de Culross, <span class="smcap">Johannes Colvile</span>
Abbas," and by "Frater Johannes Christeson," and the other brethren
of the convent. Another deed, dated 20th March 1564-5, is signed by
William Commendator, &amp;c., along with the brethren of the Convent;
John Colville, Abbot, having probably died before this. William
Commendator of Culross filled the office of Comptroller from 1546
to 1550. His name occurs among the signatures to the Book of
Discipline, see page 258. That the Commendator as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
Abbot was a Colville might be shown from several incidental notices.
One instance may suffice; in the Register of Signatures, there is recorded
the Confirmation of a pension of £61, 6s. 8d., and "twenty
bollis rynnand met of quheit, granted by umquhill <span class="smcap">Williame</span> Commendator
of Culross, and Convent thairof, <span class="smcap">to Maister Robert
Colvill brother To The said umquhill Commendator</span>," 15th
April 1569.</p>


<p class="center">II. <span class="smcap">John Abbot Of Lindores, 1540-1566.</span></p>

<p>There is much less certainty in regard to this Abbot. In a deed
dated 19th February 1539-40, John Abbot of Lindoris signs as Coadjutor
and Administrator of the Abbey of Kelso, during the minority of
Lord James Stewart Commendator, who was then under age. In
1540, John Abbot of Lindores had a seat in Parliament; and four
years later he appears as one of the Lords of Session. In the Provincial
Council held at Edinburgh in 1549, he sat as Abbot; and,
as Knox states under the year 1559, (vol. i. p. 392,) having submitted
to the Congregation, he was stigmatized as an apostate. In August
1560, he gave his sanction to the Confession of Faith. John Commendator
of Lindoris is named as having been present at the meeting
of the General Assembly, 25th June 1566, but probably did no
long survive.</p>

<p>In the "Epistolæ Regum Scotorum," there is a letter addressed
by John Duke of Albany, Governor of Scotland, to Pope Hadrian
the Sixth, dated 9th March 1521-2, which may assist in ascertaining
this point. It states that the venerable father, Henry Abbot of
Lundoris, on account of the increasing infirmities of age, "ad solicitudines
et vigilantiores loci sufferandos labores, præcipuum et
probatum virum <span class="smcap">Johannem Philp</span>, inibi professum Monachum Presbyterum,
delegit;" and therefore he had resigned to him the Abbacy,
reserving to himself for life the revenues of this benefice, requesting
his Holiness to confirm the said John Philp as Abbot. "Johannes
Philp" appears in the list of Determinants in St. Salvator's College,
St. Andrews, in 1536; and the following year "M. Johannes Philp"
is included among the Licentiates for the higher degree of Master
of Arts. That this person may have been the son or nephew of the
Abbot is by no means improbable.</p>

<p>It is not ascertained how long Abbot Henry, who sat in Parliament
in 1513, may have survived the appointment of his coadjutor in
1522. That Abbot John may have held the office for a period of
forty-five years, is, at least, a probable conjecture; and in the absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
of more direct proof, that this individual was <span class="smcap">John Philp</span>, it
may be noticed that several persons of that name appear connected
with Lindoros for a length of time. Among others, (1.) James Philp of
Ormeston, (who died in 21st January 1579-80,) and Margaret Forrest
his spouse, had a charter of lands in the Grange of Lindores, 24th
March 1574. According to his testament, confirmed 26th April 1583,
John Philp, burgess of Newburgh, was his brother-german, and
mention is made of Henry and John Philpis, as his lawfull barnes.
(2.) James Philp, junior, and Margaret Philp his spouse, had a lease
of 3<small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></small> acres of land in the regality of Lindoris, 18th October 1580.
(3.) Letters of Legitimation of Henry Philp, bastard, natural son of
Mr. John Philp in Newtoun of Lindoris, were granted 10th September
1580. (4.) The same person styled simply Henry Philp,
son of Mr. John Philp in Newburgh, had a charter of five acres in the
Hauch of Lundores in Fife, 21st December 1592.</p>


<p class="center">III. <span class="smcap">John Bishop Of Ross and Abbot of Lindores, 1560.</span></p>

<p>A few particulars may be added respecting another Abbot of Lindoris,
who was much more distinguished both in his literary and
political career&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Lesley</span>, Bishop of Ross. He was born 29th
September 1527. Knox, at page 141 of this volume, calls him "a
priest's gett," or bastard; and this assertion is fully confirmed by some
original documents which Bishop Keith examined, showing that he
was the natural son of Gawin Lesley, parson of Kingussie in Badenoch,
and Official of the See of Murray. In 1537, John Lesley obtained a
dispensation, notwithstanding the defect of his birth, to become a
clergyman. He was inducted to a canonry in the Cathedral Church
of Aberdeen and Ellon in August 1550. He then spent four years
abroad, in the study of the civil and canon laws in the University of
Poictiers; and was created a Doctor of Laws at Paris. He returned
to Scotland in April 1554; four years later, in April 1558, he was
appointed Official at Aberdeen; and in July 1559, he was inducted
to the parsonage, canonry, and prebend of Oyne. In April 1561,
he was deputed, on the part of the Roman Catholic party, to invite
the Queen to Scotland, after the death of Francis the Second. He
returned to Leith in the same vessel with her; and for a period of
upwards of twenty years continued one of the most active and zealous
adherents and assertors of the rights and character of his Royal Mistress.
On the 19th January 1563-4, he took his seat as a Lord of
Session, by his designation as Parson of Oyne. Soon afterwards he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
obtained the Abbacy of Lindores <i>in commendam</i>; and upon the death
of Henry Sinclair, Bishop of Ross, having been promoted to the vacant
See, his appointment was confirmed in April 1566.</p>

<p>Among the various documents relating to John Lesley parson of
Oyne, and afterwards Bishop of Ross, of which Keith has given some
account, is one, No. 7, which, if correctly stated, would have shown
that the name of the Abbot, his immediate predecessor, was also John
Lesley. It will be seen, however, that this is a mistake. Having
obtained a sight of the original paper, which is written in a small
hand, and full of contractions, it may be described as a petition intimating
in the usual form, that <span class="smcap">John, Abbot of the Monastery
of Lindoris</span>, of the Order of St. Benedict, in the diocese of St.
Andrews, had resigned the Abbacy in favour of <span class="smcap">John Leslie</span>, Clerk
in the diocese of Murray, and a Doctor of both Laws, who had a seat
on the bench as one of the Lords of Council in Scotland. To this
added the <i>fiat ut petitur</i>, granting Lesley a dispensation to hold this
benefice <i>in commendam</i>. It is dated "Rome apud Sanctum Petrum
sexto Kal. Martij, Anno Primo." That this was during the first
year of the Pontificate of Pius V., (who was elected on the 7th, and
crowned on the 17th January 1565-66,) is evident from the document
itself, which refers to letters in favour of Lesley, "by Henry and
Mary, King and Queen of Scotland," thus fixing the date to the 24th
February 1566.</p>

<p>In June following, John Bishop of Ross, and Commendator of
Lindores, obtained a Royal mandate, and took an active part in
regard to the confirmation of various feu-farms of lands pertaining
to the Abbey of Lindores. In the letter describing Riccio's
murder and the Queen's conduct, addressed to the Council of England
by the Earl of Bedford and Sir Thomas Randolph, the 27th March
1566, it appears that Bishop Lesley, along with his colleague James
Balfour, Parson of Flisk, was that night in Holyrood,&mdash;"Atholle
had leave of the Kinge, with Flyske <i>and Landores</i>, (<i>who was lately
called Lyslaye, the Parson of Ovne</i>,) to go where they wolde; and
being convoide oute of the courte," &amp;c. (Wright's Queen Elizabeth,
vol. i. p. 229.)</p>

<p>The latter portion of Bishop Lesley's life is well known, and need
not be detailed&mdash;his imprisonment in England in 1571&mdash;his long
residence in different parts of the continent, and his death near
Brussels on the 31st May 1596, in the sixty-ninth year of his age.
See in particular the account of his life and writings, by Dr. Irving
in his "Lives of Scotish Writers," vol. i. p. 122, &amp;c.</p>

1558. (Reg. Secr. Sigilli.) He had
previously been employed in her affairs.
In September 1555, the Treasurer paid
to William Maitland, "be the Quenis

1557-8, when sent in embassy to
London, he received from the Treasurer
600 crowns of the Sun, extending to
£765; and on the 30th March 1558-9,
he received a similar sum, when "passand

The Earl of Arran, and Lord James
Stewart, in a letter to Sadler, dated
Dysart, 19th January, make mention
of the Earl of Huntly having sent "in

There is a place still named Gleniston,
near Loch Gelly, a few miles from
Kinghorn, which belonged in the 14th

the property, by marriage, afterwards
came into the family of Boswell. There
was also Glammis Tower, or Castle, an

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> The Queen Regent, in 1558, had
made Captain James Cullen one of the
keepers of the town of Perth. As
noticed, in the following page, on the
24th January 1559-60, he and Captain
Farny, "being in ane pink, were taken;
and also ane uther schip callit the Hoy,
quhilkis were to pas in Fyff, with munitioun
to furneis the Frenche Campe."
(Diurnal of Occurrents, pp. 55, 272.)
In January 1559-60, letters had been
sent "to caus all maner of provision,
sic as breid, drink, flesche, fische, and
utheris necessaris, to follow the Frenche
army in Fyffe." (Treasurer's Accounts.)
Payments to Captain James Cullen, then
in the Queen's service, occur in the Treasurer's
Accounts, June and September
1566. His ultimate fate is recorded
in the Diurnal of Occurrents, and in
Richard Bannatyne's Memorials: having
been taken prisoner in the Canongate
on the 14th June 1571, he was
tried at Leith, and beheaded on the
17th July, at the instigation, it is said,
of the Earl of Morton.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> Count Stephen de Martigues. In
a letter from Sir N. Throkmorton to
Queen Elizabeth, 7th October 1559, in
reference to the levying of troops to be
sent from France to Scotland, he says,
"for the transporting whereof, it is
said, one Monsieur Martigues is appointed
chief conducteur; who is a
Gentleman of the Kingis chamber, of the
state of a Conte, in good estimacioun,
and heretier to the Duke de Temps:
and there be ships already in order at
Calais, and other parts upon this side."
(Forbes's State Papers, vol. i. p. 248.) In
another letter, it is said, "The Marques
D'Albeuf and Martigues are appointed
to take shipping at Calice, the last of
this monethe, November," (Ib. p. 257;)
and letters of a subsequent date contain
other allusions to their progress.
See <i>supra</i>, page 4, note 3. In a letter
to Cecil, written from Dover, 24th
January 1559-60, Throkmorton, reports
the information he had then received,
"That Martigues hath been all this
his missinge tyme in the North Isles
of Orkeney; and that he is now salfflie
arryved in Scotlande, with his viii
enseignes of footemen, and well landed
them all," with the exception of one of
the ships which was driven away by
the violence of the weather, before the
men were put ashore, and was supposed
to be lost. (Ib. p. 307.) He also mentions
the capture, at night, of one of the
ships, after all the stuff had been taken
out of it. On the 22d February he informs
the High Admiral of England, that
the Marquis D'Elbeuf, "now soddenly,

Tullibody House, the seat of
Lord Abercromby, is situated near the
banks of the Forth. The Church, which
was partially demolished by the French
in January 1559-60, is a building of
great antiquity. In the course of the
last century, it was new roofed and
repaired, to serve as the burial-place
of the family, and has occasionally
been used as a preaching station. The
destruction of the Church of Tullibody
is mentioned in the several histories
of the time. Although the French were
enabled to "make ane sure passage,
baith for horsemen and footemen," to
cross the water, and came to Stirling
on the 28th of that month, Pitscottie

Knox to Cecil, written from Dieppe in

was not calculated to conciliate the
favour of the English statesman; and
we need not be surprised to find Cecil,
in a letter dated "from the Court," on
the last of October, saying to Sadler,
"<i>Of all others Knoxees name</i>, if it be not

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> Sir William Cecil, the eminent
statesman, had been Secretary of State
in the reign of Edward VI. Under
Queen Mary, he acted with so much
caution, although known to be a Protestant,
that he remained unmolested,
professing, among other reasons, "that
he thought himself bound to serve God
first, and next the Queen; but if her
service should put him out of God's
service, he hoped her Majesty would
give him leave to chuse an everlasting
rather than a momentary service."
From the strain of Knox's letter to
him, it might be inferred he had complied
more ostensibly with the Romish
party; but immediately upon Queen
Elizabeth's accession to the throne,
Cecil became a Privy Councillor, and
was reinstated in his office of Secretary.
He was afterwards raised to the
peerage as Lord Burghley, and was appointed
Lord High Treasurer. He died
in 1598.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> This desire of Knox, repeated so
frequently in subsequent letters, to be
allowed to visit England, was ungraciously
refused, or allowed for many
months to pass unnoticed. On the 9th
of July, after Knox had reached Scotland,
but still expressing the same
anxious desire to see his brethren in
the North of England, Cecil wrote to
Sir Nicholas Throkmorton: "<i>Knoxe
desireth to come hyther</i>: if he might
come secretly, I wold allow it; otherwise
not." On the 13th of June, Throkmorton,
in a letter to Queen Elizabeth,
had mentioned that Knox's wife and
his mother-in-law were then in Paris,
intending to return through England,
and that he had promised letters in
their favour to Secretary Cecil; and he
entreated her Majesty to overlook "his
former faultes." On the 19th of July,
after stating "of what importance the
successe of thinges touching religion in
Scotland is for us," Throkmorton
strongly urges upon Cecil the expediency
"that Knokes have liberty to
repair into England, how short soever
his abode be there." (Forbes's State
Papers, vol. i. pp. 129, 155, 167.) From
Cecil's own letter, on the 28th of July,
(see page 34,) it appears that he had requested
Knox to meet him at Stamford;
but the course of events, as related at
page 32, prevented his travelling beyond
Berwick.</p></div>

(Forbes's State Papers, vol. i p. 137.)
On the 28th June, he was the bearer of a

a defect in the previous Book,
where the application made by the
Protestants for aid from England is
scarcely alluded to; and as there is an
apparent confusion in some of the dates,
owing to the letters being partially or
inaccurately copied, a few words of explanation
may here be added. Knox's
conversation with Kirkaldy of Grange,
(see page 21,) took place at St. Andrews,
after Cupar Muir, before the end of
June 1559; and letters from Kirkaldy,
to Cecil and Percy, on the 23d and 25th
of that month, and on the 1st of July,
are still preserved. Knox himself wrote
to Cecil, on the 28th June. The result
of their correspondence was, that
Whytelaw, who had then returned from
France, and having passed through
England, had brought letters from Sir
William Cecil, was sent back on the 20th
of July, as the bearer of the letters
from the Lords of the Congregation,
and from Knox, to Cecil and Queen
Elizabeth, which are printed in pages
22 to 30. After Whytelaw's departure,
Knox received a letter from Sir Henry
Percy, wishing that they should meet at
Alnwick. His journey thither was delayed,
in consequence of the Queen and
the French troops having advanced from
Dunbar, on Monday the 23d of July, and
the Congregation having retired from
Edinburgh on the 24th; but Knox, after
a short delay, passed through Fife to
Pittenweem, and crossed the Firth to
Holy Island. Having acceded to the
suggestions of Sir James Crofts, instead
of proceeding farther, he remained at
Berwick until Whytelaw came with
Cecil's letter, on the 2d or 3d of August:
(see page 35, note 1.)</p></div>

time, prudently returned by sea to
Fife:" the above statement, I think,
clearly shows, he must have returned
by land. He set out from Berwick, in
company with Whytelaw, on the 3d of
August, but the latter <i>being detained on
the road</i> by sickness, Knox proceeded,
without delay, and reached Stirling on
or before the 6th of August, on which
day he addressed letters to Sir James
Crofts: see Tytler's Hist. vol. vi. pp.
127, 130. Soon afterwards, Whytelaw
having recovered, and set out on his journey,
along with William Knox, <i>when between
Preston and Edinburgh</i>, they were
pursued by Lord Seaton, and narrowly
escaped: see vol. i. p. 393.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_91_91" id="Footnote_91_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91_91"><span class="label">[91]</span></a> The result of Knox's previous communications
was very important, having
led to the resolution of the English
Council to support the Protestants in
Scotland in their contest with the Queen
Regent, but with so much secrecy as
might not infringe the treaty of peace
between the two kingdoms. For this
purpose a commission was granted on
the 8th of August to Sir Ralph Sadler,
in conjunction with the Earl of Northumberland
and Sir James Crofts, to
reside at Berwick, ostensibly to settle
some Border disputes, and to strengthen
the fortifications of that city; and the
sum of £3000 was placed at Sadler's
disposal. A similar sum was paid to
him on the 5th of October; and a third
payment in November. It was part of
this money that was sent to Scotland
with Balnaves, and with Cockburn of
Ormiston. (See Letter of Queen Elizabeth
to Sadler, in Sir H. Ellis's Original
Letters, 3d Series, vol. iii. p. 332.)&mdash;Sadler's
Correspondence, extending from
August 1559 to April 1560, (included

in 1537, on account of Aske's rebellion,
and brother of Thomas seventh Earl of
Northumberland. Having remained
attached to the Queen, and even taken
arms against the insurgents, in the

his brother and Westmoreland, he
escaped one great peril, and succeeded
to the family titles and domains upon
his brother's execution, in 1572. But
having engaged in Lord Paget's enterprise

June, he is called "Betoncourt, the
Scotishe Quenis Master d'hostel," (ib. p.
141); again, on the 29th July, "Butomcourt,
which I thinke passed through

and to dissemble with them</i>; supposing
that to be the best meane to worke

the 8th August, he further says, there
was "sent by Botuncourt, at his last

Dowager, signed by the French King
and Queen." (Ib. 193.) His arrival in

Balmuto, and Balweary. In reference
to the statement in the text, Sir Ralph
Sadler, in a letter dated 4th February

time on the Continent; and passed Advocate,
1st March 1549. He was twice
married; Marion Blyth, his first wife,
died 24th March 1570, (Register of Confirmed
Testaments.) His second wife,
Margaret Guthrie, having survived him,
married Mr. John Lindesay, second son
of Sir David Lindesay of Edzell, and
Parson of Menmuir. According to Scot
of Scotstarvet, Borthwick had acquired
"many lands in Lothian and Fife, as
Balnacreiff, Admiston, Balcarras, and
others; but having infest his son, Sir

Sadler (State Papers, vol. i. pp. 431,

"Macconnell," and says, 8th Sept. 1559,
that the Queen Regent had endeavoured
to stir him, "and others of the Scottish
Irishrie, against the Erle of Argyle," to
prevent Argyle from rendering aid to
his associates, the Lords of the Congregation.
</p><p>
In a Report on the state of the West
Isles of Scotland drawn up by the Dean
of Limerick, in 1595 or 1596, James
M<sup>c</sup>Connell is specially mentioned as
having been "holden in great jealousie
by the house of Argyle." It is further
added, that "Anne Cambell, halfe
syster to the aforesayde Erle, the wife
to the Sherif of Bute, by whome she
was hardlie entreated; ... by reason
of her hard usadge jorneyinge towards
Argeile, she was intercepted by the
said James, and marryed; by whome
she had five sonnes and a daughter."
(Miscellany of the Maitland Club, vol.
iv. p. 44.) As James Stewart, Sheriff
of Bute, had lawful issue by a second
marriage, he probably had obtained a
divorce from his first wife.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_121_121" id="Footnote_121_121"></a><a href="#FNanchor_121_121"><span class="label">[121]</span></a> Knox has here inserted the Articles
of the Convention at Berwick, 27th February
1559-60, as confirmed by the
Duke of Chattelherault, at Leith, 10th
May 1560, "after the incoming of the
English armies," (Calderwood's Hist.
vol. i. p. 578.) In this confirmation the
signatures of the Scotish Commissioners
to the Articles are omitted, as the copy
it embodied was that exchanged with
the said Commissioners, and attested by
Thomas Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marischal
of England, as Commissioner from
Queen Elizabeth. The original Articles,
with the signatures of the Scotish Commissioners,
as given in the text above,
along with the clause enclosed within
brackets, are inserted in Rymer's F&oelig;dera,
etc., vol. xv. p. 569; edit. 1740, vol. vi.
par. iv. p. 95, under this title, "Conventiones
Scotorum contra Reginam Unionem
Franciæ et Scotiæ designantem, et
pro Defensione contra Francos." A copy
of these Articles, from a minute endorsed
by Secretary Cecil, and printed
among the Burghley State Papers, p.
253, omits the testing clause altogether.
In the same volume, there is a letter
from the Duke of Norfolk to the Privy
Council, last of February, stating,&mdash;
"that these three daies have we been
in conference and consultation with the
Lords of Scotland, upon this great and
weighty matter." Copies of this Convention
are also preserved among the
Cotton. MSS. Calig. B. ix. fol. 34, and
B. x, fol. 69. The Commission, dated
29th March 1560, added to one of these
MSS., has thefollowing marginal note by
Sir Robert Cotton:&mdash;"It seems by the
Commission given by the Queen for confirmation
of these Articles, dated in the
month of March following, that this
treaty was concluded before the Queen
would openly profess herself a party,
which is to be noted."</p></div>

on the 25th January 1559-60,&mdash;"It is
thought that the Quene Douagier shalbe
received very shortlie into the Castell
of Edinburgh, for any travaile that can
be to the contrarie, with her onlie howsholde
servaunts and gentlewoomen."
Two months later, on the 28th March
1560, he says, "It hath been longe in
doubte whether the Quene Douagier
woolde either to the Castell of Edinburgh
or to Lythe; it is saide, that it is
now resolved, that it will to the Castell
this daye."&mdash;(State Papers, vol. i. pp.
696, 712.) That the Queen had the
purpose of entering the Castle at the
time first specified, is evident from an
incidental notice in the Treasurer's Accounts
of his having paid £8 on the 26th
January 1559-60, "to Maister Johne
Balfour, for transporting of the Quenis
Grace cofferis fra the Abbay of Halierudhous
to the Castell of Edinburgh."
On the same day, a messenger was sent
"with clois writtingis of the Quenis
Grace to Monsr. Dosell;" and two days
later 17s. was paid "to ane boy passand
of Edinburgh, with clois writtingis
of the Quenis Grace to Monsr. Labroce,
rynnand all the nycht." On the last
of January, the Queen herself received
the sum of £250. The actual date when
the Queen passed from Holyrood House
to the Castle, was the 1st of April.

was the Hospital or Preceptory of St.
Anthony, founded by Robert Logan of
Restalrig, in 1435. It stood near the
Kirkgate Street, at the south-west corner
of what is still called St. Anthony's
Wynd; and is said to have been the
only establishment in Scotland belonging
to the Canons of St. Anthony.
During the siege in May 1560, the building
was probably nearly all demolished.
On the 17th of that month, the English
troops having raised earthen mounds
for their great ordinance, "beganne
to shoote at Sanct Anthonyes steeple

the Reformation, is simply entitled,
"The Last Band at Leyth." It was
printed "from the Original" at Hamilton
Palace, by Bishop Burnet, in his
History of the Reformation, vol. iii. p.
287. It was probably not very accurately
transcribed, but some slight corrections
from that work have been
adopted. It was reprinted in the Appendix

p. 273. In all these copies, as well as
in Knox, the names of the Lords and

British Museum, among the Harleian
MSS. (No. 289. fol. 70.) has enabled me

31, Sir James Crofts was captain of the
Town and Castle of Berwick, and warden
of East Marches. "He had," says
Sir Walter Scott, "a good military reputation;
having governed Ireland, and
defended Haddington (in 1547) against
the French and the Scotch. He was
attainted by Queen Mary, but restored
by Queen Elizabeth, and made Governor
of Berwick; an office which he enjoyed
at the date of these letters." (State
Papers, vol. i. p. 387.) But Crofts, for
his conduct at this time, was impeached
by the Duke of Norfolk, and removed
from his office as Governor, which was
conferred on Lord Gray. He afterwards
became Comptroller of the Household,
and died in 1595.</p></div>

Solway. (State Papers, vol. i. pp. 182,
348.) His name occurs as signing the
Bond in April 1560: (see page 63.) It
may be questioned, therefore, whether
Knox is quite correct in the names of
the persons whom he mentions as having
openly opposed the Confession in
Parliament. See in the Appendix an
extract from Randolph the English envoy's
letter to Sir William Cecil, on the
19th of August, in which he says, "of
the Temporal Lords, the Earl of Cassillis,
and the Earl of Caithness, said Noe;
the rest of the Lords, with common
consent, allowed the same." (Tytler's

the Reformers; this mission to France
shews the estimation in which he was
held. Having obtained a grant of the
possessions of the Knights Templars
and Hospitallers in Scotland in 1563,
the same were erected into a Free Barony
or a Temporal Lordship, in his favour,
by Queen Mary, as Lord Torphichen;
and he relinquished his former
title of Lord St. John. See the copy of
the Charter, dated 24th January 1563-4,

Mr. <span class="smcap">George Buchanan</span>. He was in
France at the time of the King's death,
and it is highly probable he may not

so much with the prose writings
and the few letters of Buchanan written
in his native tongue, as to warrant
this ascription: but in either case,
whether translated by Buchanan or

was Peter de la Place, an
eminent lawyer, whom Henry the Second
had appointed King's Advocate
and President of the Court of Aids, in
Paris. In 1560, he openly avowed himself
a Protestant, which obliged him to
leave Paris, and in the troubles that
followed, his library and effects were
pillaged or destroyed; and he himself
eventually became one of the victims in
the atrocious massacre of the Protestants
on the eve of St. Bartholomew,
25th August 1572.</p></div>

But here it may be mentioned, that the

in a different hand, (most likely by
Knox himself,) and clearly posterior to
the rest of the page. By attending therefore
to the dates of Lesley's successive
appointments, this serves to fix the
period when this portion of the History
was written to the earlier part of the
year 1566.</p></div>

Sinclair's life; and along with the similar
mention of the Dean of Restalrig,
in the Author's emphatic terms,
"as a perfect hypocrite," (vol. i. p.
265,) it corroborates the supposition
that the greater portion of this MS.
must have been written in the year
1566. It will be seen from the footnotes
on the passage referred to, that
Mr. John Sinclair, Dean of Restalrig,
was promoted to the See of Brechin in
1563, and became President of the
Court of Session, 13th November 1565.

to repair to Queen Mary, by the Convention,
15th January 1560-1. Chalmers
is undoubtedly correct when he
says, he had no authority, to persuade
the Queen to return to Scotland. (Life of
Queen Mary, vol. iii. p. 141.) But Lord
James, as we are informed by Randolph,
was in no hurry to depart "till he see
what will be done at the ensuing Parliament."
(Ib.) In a letter to Cecil, 7th
February 1560-1, he desires a passport,
"being ordered by the Nobility and
Council, to our Sovereign, for declaration
of our duty and devotion to her
Highness." (Ib.) He left Edinburgh, on
his way to France, 18th March, passing
through England, where he was well
entertained, and reached the town of
Diziers, where Queen Mary was residing,
on the 15th April 1561. (Bishop
Lesley's History, p. 294.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_309_309" id="Footnote_309_309"></a><a href="#FNanchor_309_309"><span class="label">[309]</span></a> In the MS. 1566, of Knox's History,
several blank pages occur after these
words; but the deficiency, consisting of
the "Forme and Order of the Election
of Superintendents," &amp;c., (ending at
page 150 of the present volume,) has
been supplied from the Glasgow MS.,
collated with a copy annexed to "The
Ordour of Excommunication," &amp;c., subjoined
to an edition of the Psalms and
Prayers, printed at Edinburgh, by Robert
Charteris, 1596. It is also included
in the "Collection of Confessions
of Faith," &amp;c., vol. ii. p. 625, Edinb.
1722. The Editor says, he has printed
it according to an edition by Robert
Lekprevik 1569; and that "it differs
little from the ordinary copies that are
printed with the old Psalms, but in the
manner of spelling of words."
</p><p>
The Editor of the Collection of Confessions,
thus mentions the Order of
Election of Elders and Deacons: "It
is uncertain when this was written; but
it is in the Manuscript copy of Knox's
History, which is in the College Library
of Glasgow, and is printed at Edinburgh,
with other publick papers, by
Robert Lekprevik, Anno 1569, according
to which this edition is printed. It
is approved by the General Assembly,
April 1582, Sess. 12, in these words,&mdash;'Concerning
ane General Ordor of Admission
to the Office of Eldaris, referris
it to the Ordor usit at Edinburgh, quhilk
we approve.'"
</p><p>
The Admonition or prayer at the end,
(see page 154,) in its reference to the
King and Regent, apparently fixes the
date to the year 1568.</p></div>

about the year 1510, and was educated
at Glasgow. His name occurs in the
University records, as incorporated in
1534, being designed "Servus domini
Rectoris." In 1536 he had taken his
degree as Master of Arts. He is said
to have been in England from 1538 to
1543, and to have returned with the
Earl of Glencairn. In 1548 he was
presented to the Vicarage of Calder.
Having early joined the Reformers, he
was nominated as Superintendent of
Lothian in July 1560, and was admitted,
agreeably to the above form, 9th March
1561, without resigning his charge as
minister of Calder. (Wodrow Miscellany,
vol. i. p. 367.) He may, with much
more truth, be said to have "continued
in this holy function, with the approbation
of all good men, till his death," than
to "have exercised fully the power, and
discharged faithfully the office of a
Bishop, though under another style;"
(Life prefixed to Spottiswood's History,
Lond. 1655, folio.) The office of Superintendent
was merely temporary;
and he himself displayed no assumption
of authority over his brethren in the
ministry, nor aspired after Episcopal
dignity. He died 5th December 1585.
His eldest son, who became his successor
as Minister of Calder, was ultimately
Archbishop of St. Andrews, and Lord
Chancellor of Scotland.</p></div>

immorality passed about this time, in
Parliament, and in the Civil as well as
Ecclesiastical Courts. One of these
Acts of the Town Council of Edinburgh,
when about to be enforced against a
delinquent in the person of John Sanderson,
Deacon of the Fleshers, led to the
tumult to which Knox refers. On the
22d November 1560, "The quhilk day
the Baillies and Counsale being convenit
in the Over Counsale House of
the Tolbuith of this bur<sup>t</sup>. Comperit
William Harlay, dekin of the Hammarmen,
and certane uthir craftismen, and
desyrit the decreit and sentence gevin
aganis Jhone Sandersone, dekin of the
Fleschouris, decernying him to be cartit

Lyell, to be continewit quhill the morne:
Quhilk the Provost, Baillies, and Counsale
foresaid grantit, and thairupoun
the said William askis instruments."
</p><p>
On the following day the Council
having adhered to their resolution that
the sentence against Sanderson should
be carried into effect; this was so much
resented by the craftsmen of the town
as a dishonour, that they assembled in
a tumultuous manner, broke up the
prison, and set him at liberty. The
Magistrates having immediately complained
to the Lords of the Secret Council,
several persons connected with this
tumult, were apprehended and imprisoned
in the Castle of Edinburgh.
There are several entries in the Town
Council Records on this subject: see
the account given in Maitland's History
of Edinburgh, p. 20.</p></div>

an Advocate. On the 25th June
1554, he was advanced to be Clerk-Register;
and continued to be employed
in various public affairs. He joined
the Reformers, but on account of his
concern in the murder of David Riccio,
9th March 1566, he fled from Edinburgh,

of May, the games of Robin Hood were
attended with so much disorderly license,
that they were ordered to be
suppressed by an Act of the Scotish
Parliament in 1555. It is not easy,
however, to abolish long continued customs;
and complaints to the General
Assembly for their continued observance
were made until the close of the
16th century. Of the tumult that took
place in Edinburgh, on the 21st of
June 1561, a very minute and interesting
account is preserved in the Diurnal
of Occurrents, pp. 283-4.

Several persons were brought to
trial on account of these riots. On the
20th July 1561, Robert Hannay, smith,
and nine others were tried, as art and
part in choosing George Durye in the
month of April last, and calling him
Lord of Inobedience, and for rioting on
Sunday the 12th May. (See Pitcairn's

note 3.) Queen Mary, in a letter to
Throkmorton, dated at Nancy 22d April
1561, declares that Lord James who
was then with her, had come without
any special mission: "Quant à Lord
James qui est devers moy, il y est venue
pour son devoir, comme devers sa souveraine
Dame, que je suis, sans charge
ou commission qui concerne autre chose
que son droit." She was anxious he
should not return through England;
and there can be no doubt, his conduct
was too much influenced by the English
Court. See the letters quoted by Mr.
Tytler, vol. vi. pages 218 to 225. Lord
James returned from France before the
end of May 1561. The Diurnal of Occurrents
(p. 283) has the 19th of May;
but according to a letter quoted by Mr.
Tytler, it appears that Lord James was
in London on the 20th of that month,
but had reached Edinburgh on the 3d
of June. (History, vol. vi. p. 225.)</p></div>

of the German troops which
formed one of the divisions of the French
forces sent to Scotland in 1548. He
distinguished himself at the sieges of
Haddington and Dundee. (Lesley's History,
pp. 206, 207, 219, 223.) He returned
to France in 1549, but it seems
doubtful whether he again visited this
country. He appears to have settled
in France. John Philip Rheingrave,
Count Palatine of the Rhine, before
1554, married an heiress, Jean de Genoüillac,
the widow of Charles Seigneur
de Crussol, Vicomte d'Uzés. (Anselme,
Hist. Geneal. vol. iii. p. 768.) In December
1562, "the Rhyngrave lost fourscore
of his horsemen," or, "reisters,"
when Harfleur was taken by the English.

full share of credit for destroying the
ecclesiastical buildings of this country,
I may be permitted to call the reader's
attention to Dr. M'Crie's remarks on the
"Alleged Excesses of the Reformers,"
in his notes to the Life of Knox, vol. ii.
pages 450-456. But it might not be difficult
to show that the actual devastations
committed by the Reformers have
been greatly exaggerated. The object
they had in view was not to destroy
the buildings, but to remove objects of
idolatrous worship and superstition.
It should also be remembered, that the
revenues appropriated for keeping such
buildings in repair, being diverted to
other channels, these large and imposing
edifices, more suited for the services of
the Romish Church than the simpler
forms of Presbyterian worship, were allowed
to fall into utter ruin. When
portions were restored to serve as parish
churches, this was too often done but
little in accordance with their original
richly decorated style of architecture.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_343_343" id="Footnote_343_343"></a><a href="#FNanchor_343_343"><span class="label">[343]</span></a> The words inclosed within brackets,
omitted in the MS. 1566, and in Vautr.

i.p. 124, it is mentioned, that John Hamilton,
who afterwards became Archbishop
of St. Andrews, had obtained the
Abbacy of Paisley in the year 1525.
In 1544, he proposed to resign Paisley
to his brother James, reserving to himself
the whole fruits of the benefice, with
a right to re-enter to it, should his
brother predecease him. (Epist. Regum
Scot. vol. ii. p. 212.) This arrangement
probably was not confirmed; as
the Abbot eventually resigned the Commendatorship
to Lord Claud Hamilton,
third son of James Duke of Chattelherault.
This appears to have taken
place in 1553, when Lord Claud was
aged eleven years; the Archbishop still
acting as Administrator in spiritual as
well as temporal matters, till the Commendator
had attained the age of twenty-three.
In various deeds, so late as
April 1565, the former continued to be
styled "John, &amp;c. Archbishop of Sanctandrois,
Primat and Legat of the haill
Realme of Scotland, and Abbot of the
Abbay of Pasley." Lord Claud Hamilton
was the ancestor of the Earls of
Abercorn.</p></div>

vol. i. pp. 328 and 355. Lord Clinton,
in a letter to the Earl of Sussex, 8th
August 1560, mentions that D'Oysel
and Martigues, having 3500 French
soldiers in their company, had then
landed at Calais, on their return from
Scotland. Queen Mary had purposed
sending him again to Scotland in the
spring of 1561. From letters of the
time we learn he was not expected to
reach Greenwich before the 8th of July,
and Cecil on the 25th of that month
says, "Monser d'Oyzell came from the
Scottish Quene, with request that the
Quene his Mistress might have a salve
conduct to pass alongst our sea coast,
and hymself to pass into Scotland to
provide for her coming. Many reasons
moved us to myslike her passadge,
but this only served us for answer,"
&amp;c., namely, her refusal to ratify the
Treaty of Peace. It is added, "Monser
d'Oyzell was also gently required to
returne with this answer." (Wright's
Queen Elizabeth, vol. i. pp. 43, 62, 66.)
Mr. Tytler has shown, that D'Oysel
"was altogether unworthy of the trust
reposed in him," by his secret communications
both to the English Ambassador
and Queen Elizabeth. (Hist. vol. vi.

Edinburgh, 4th March 1573, says,
"Stephen Wilson, that carried letters
from the Erle of Argile into France, is
returned, and taken by the Regentis
commandment. To-morrow he shall be
examined." (Wright's Queen Elizabeth,
vol. i. pp. 220, 470.) His intercepted
correspondence is also mentioned in
Killegrew's letter, on the 9th March,
quoted by Mr. Tytler, vol. vii. p. 340.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_365_365" id="Footnote_365_365"></a><a href="#FNanchor_365_365"><span class="label">[365]</span></a> Mr. James Thornton became one of
the dignified clergy, and enjoyed the parsonage
of Alves, and the vicarage of Lanbryde,
as Chantor of Murray. In 1559,
he was at Rome employed with John
Row, (who afterwards became the Protestant
minister of Perth,) in transacting
some ecclesiastical matters. In
1562, when the Rentals of the Benefices
were given in to the Commissioners, he
made several of the returns in the
diocese of Murray. One of these was
the Chantorie of Murray, rendered by
"Maister James Thorntoun in name
and behalf, and as procurar of his Eme
(uncle) Maister John Thornetoun eldar,
quha is in titell of the said Chantorie."
Another was the parsonage of Adwy,
given in by him, "in name and as
procurar for <i>his brother</i>, Maister Johnne
Thornetoun younger, possessor and
titular of the samyn." He appears to
have been an active and confidential
agent of James Beaton, Archbishop of
Glasgow, (who had retired to France,
after the establishment of the Reformation,)
in carrying on his negotiations
with this country. Queen Mary addressed
a letter to Queen Elizabeth,
27th May 1565, requesting a safe conduct
"for Maister James Thorntoun,
Secretair to the Archbishop of Glasgo,
as Ambassatour in France." In 1566
he brought from France the Bond mentioned
in the preceding note. It was
about this time that he obtained, probably
as his uncle's successor, the titular
appointment of Chantor of Murray.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_366_366" id="Footnote_366_366"></a><a href="#FNanchor_366_366"><span class="label">[366]</span></a> The whole of this concluding sentence,
and the Book of Discipline itself,
are omitted in the Glasgow MS. In
such of the later MSS. of Knox as contain
the Book of Discipline, it is literally
copied from Calderwood's printed edition
in 1621; in small 4to, pp. [xvi.]
and 92.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_367_367" id="Footnote_367_367"></a><a href="#FNanchor_367_367"><span class="label">[367]</span></a> Archbishop Spotiswood, in his History
of the Church of Scotland, (edit.
1655, pp. 152-174,) has also introduced
a copy of the Book of Discipline, and
assigns the following reason for doing
so: "In the Convention kept at Edinburgh
in January preceding [1560-1], a
form of Church-policy was presented,
and desired to be ratified. Because
this will fall to be often mentioned, and
serveth to the clearing of many questions
which were afterward agitated in
the Church; I thought meet word by
word here to insert the same, that the
Reader may see what were the grounds
laid down at first for the Government
of the Church, so we shall the better
decerne of the changes that followed."
(Hist. p. 152.)
</p><p>
Spotiswood does not state from what
authority he has given it; but it is undeniable
that he has curtailed various
passages which will be pointed out in
the Appendix, in the note on the Book
of Discipline. At the conclusion he
adds,&mdash;"This was the Policy desired
to be ratified: It had been formed by
<span class="smcap">John Knox</span>, partly in imitation of the
reformed Churches of Germany, partly
of that he had seen in Geneva; whence
he took that device of annuall Deacons
for collecting and dispensing the Church
rents, whereof in the sixth head he
speaketh; I cannot say." (Ib. p. 174.)
</p><p>
It is scarcely necessary to remark,
that the Second Book of Discipline,
forming part of Calderwood's edition,
was of a subsequent date, having been
agreed upon in the General Assembly
1578, inserted in the Registers of the
Assembly 1581, and recognised by Parliament
in 1592.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_368_368" id="Footnote_368_368"></a><a href="#FNanchor_368_368"><span class="label">[368]</span></a> There is no separate title either in
the MS. 1566, or in Vautrollier's edition,
which contains the earlier portion of the
<span class="smcap">Book of Discipline</span>. (See note 1, page
197.) The edition 1621, quoted in the
foot-notes, was published anonymously
by David Calderwood the historian, and
was evidently printed in Holland. A
copy of the title-page is herewith annexed.
It was reprinted in the "Collection
of Confessions of Faith," &amp;c.,
with a separate title-page, dated 1721,
but the volume ii. (pp. 515-608,) containing
it, was not completed until
1722. The Editor says, "This edition
is according to that which was printed
in 1621," correcting typographical errors,
and supplying "from other copies
some words which probably have
been omitted by the printer." It is to
be regretted that he should not have
specified what "other copies" he made
use of. But one of these, no doubt, was
Spotiswood's, referred to in note 2,
page 181.

enough, in Calderwood's edition,

compiled for the use of the English congregation
at Geneva, while Knox was
minister there. It bears this title:
"The Forme of Prayers and Ministration
of the Sacraments, &amp;c., used in the
English Churche at Geneva," &amp;c. From
Knox's share in this book of Common
Order, it will be included in a subsequent
volume of his Works. Having
been subsequently approved and received
by the Church of Scotland, the
Geneva edition of 1558 was reprinted
at Edinburgh in 1562; and it continued
with occasional alterations, to be prefixed
to most editions of the old metrical
version of the Psalms, printed in this
country. The translation of Calvin's
Catechism, first reprinted at Edinburgh
in 1564, was also usually adjoined to
the volume.</p></div>

or Sciennes, were Nuns of the Predicant
Order of St. Dominick. Their Convent,
consecrated to St. Katherine of
Sienna, an erection of so late a date
as 1517, was situated a short distance
to the south of Edinburgh. The
name of the Sciennes, still designates
the locality. King James the Fifth,
soon after his assuming the government,
granted to the "Sisters of the Senys,"
an annual pension of £24; and from the
Treasurer's Accounts, it appears that
this sum was continued until 1558, to be
paid by the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise.
A volume printed for the Abbotsford
Club, in 1841, entitled "Liber Conventus
S. Katherine Senensis prope Edinburgum,"
includes the "Constitutiones
Sororum," &amp;c., along with the several
Charters that could be recovered relating
to this Convent.</p></div>

Bishop Lesley in describing the persons
who accompanied the young Princess
in her voyage to France in 1548, (see
vol. i. p. 219,) says, "Of the quhilkis
thair was four in speciall, of whome
everie one of thame buir the samin name
of Marie, being of four syndre honourable
houses, to wyt, Flemyng, Levingstoun,
Setoun, and Beatoun of Creich;
quho remanit all foure with the Quene
in France, during her residens thair,
and returned agane in Scotland with
her Majestie, in the yeir of our Lorde
J<sup>m</sup> V<sup>c</sup> lxj yeiris." (History, p. 209.)
And in his account of the Queen's arrival
in Scotland in 1561, he repeats
that she was attended "with many ladies
and gentillwemen, speciallie the
four maidis of honour quha passit with
hir Hienes in France, of hir awin aige,
the name everie ane of Marie, as is before
mentioned." (Ib. p. 297.) Buchanan,
in his verses, The Pomp of the Gods at
the Marriage of Queen Mary, 29th
July 1565, speaks of her <i>five</i> Maries.
When she arrived in this country she
was still in her first dule or mourning
dress. But on the 11th November
some change was made in the dresses of
her pages and maidens; and one of the
entries in the Treasurer's Accounts on
that day, is as follows:&mdash;"Item, be the
Quenis Grace precept, to Jacques de
Soulis, talliour to hir Grace, to gif the

black stannyng for clokis, and
black velvet to 14 dames, damosels, and
maidens, "to be thair secund dule;" to
the extent of £144, 18s., and £112, 16s.

for the following sums, £37, 10s. to be
paid "to John Terrie, maister of ane

It may be added, that the Grand
Prior, the Sieur Damville, and most of
their attendants, returned by land, intending
to visit the English Court. They
were accompanied to Berwick by several
of the Scottish Nobility; the Queen
having addressed letters "to some
Lords and others to convoy the Grande
Priour and Mons<sup>r</sup>. Damweile of Edinburgh
to Berwick," on the 8th and 9th
of October. About the same time, the
Treasurer "deliverit to the Quenis

her Master Stabler, on the 6th
September, purchased 10 horses or

two of her Uncles, Monsieur Damville,
and a number of ladies. She set out
from Holyrood Palace on horseback,
after dinner, on the 11th of that month,
and remained at Linlithgow Palace that
night, and the following day; on the
13th she rode to Stirling Castle, and
was there on Sunday the 14th; on the
15th she passed through Alloa to Kincardine,
or, as some authorities state,
to Leslie Castle in Fife; on the 17th she
came to Perth; on the 19th to Dundee;
crossed the Tay to St. Andrews, on the
20th; a few days afterwards she proceeded
to Falkland Palace; and returned
to Holyrood on Monday the 29th
of September 1561. (Chalmers's Queen

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_669_669" id="Footnote_669_669"></a><a href="#FNanchor_669_669"><span class="label">[669]</span></a> From the preceding note it will be
seen that Queen Mary returned from
her progress on the 29th of September;
and that Knox has mistaken the date of
her first entry into Edinburgh. It was
on Tuesday the 2d September. A minute
and interesting notice of it occurs in the
Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 67, but the
passage is too long for quotation. She
rode through the town to the Castle,
where she dined at 12 o'clock; and then
returning, various pageants were represented
in different parts of the town, as
she proceeded, convoyed by the nobility
and chief inhabitants, dressed in velvet
gowns and bonnets, carrying a pall of
fine purple velvet, with fringes of gold
and silk. Upon reaching the Palace
of Holyrood, she received a <i>propyne</i>,
or gift of a cupboard, "quhilk was
double our-gilt; the price thairof was
2000 merks." Randolph, in his letter
to Cecil, on the 7th September, also
mentions that part of the pageant to
which Knox alludes. He says, "Upon
Tuesday last the Queen made her entry.
She dyned in the Castle. The fyrst
syghte she sawe after she cam oute of
the Castle, was a boye of six yeres of
age, that cam, as it were, from heaven
oute of a rounde globe, that presented
unto hir a Bible and Psalter, and the
keys of the gates, and spake unto her
the verses which I send you. There,
for the terrible sygnifications of the
vengeance of God upon idolatrie, ther
war burnt Coron, Dathan, and Abiram,
in the tyme of thair sacrifice. Thei war
mynded to have had a priest (that is,
the representation of a priest) burned
at the altar, at the elevation. The Erle
of Huntlye stayed that pagent, but hath
playde manye as wicked as that since
he came hyther." (Wright's Queen
Elizabeth, vol. i. p. 73.) The expenses
attending the "Banquet" on the 31st
August, and the "Triumph," on the 2d
September, cost the inhabitants of Edinburgh
the sum of 4000 merks, which it
was resolved should be levied by a general
stent or assessment.</p></div>

Queen's guard. He was present at supper
in Queen Mary's apartment the
night of Riccio's murder. And having
escaped from her temporary confinement
in Holyrood, on the night of the
11th of March 1566, she "came to the
place where Arthur Ersken, the captayn
of her garde kept the horses, and
so rode her waye behinde Arthur Erskin
untill she cam to Seton. There she
took a horse to herself, and rode to Dunbarre,"
&amp;c. (Wright's Queen Elizabeth,
vol. i. p. 231.) In April 1562, the Treasurer
paid "be the Quenis Grace speciall
command, to Arthur Erskin to by
him ane hors, £40:" and on the 2d of
June 1565, in like manner there was
paid "to Arthur Erskin ane of the
maisteris of hir Graces Curie to by him
ane horse, xx crownis." In December
1564, he is styled "Arthur Erskine of
Blackgrange, brother-german to John
Lord Erskine." (Register of Signatures.)
He was probably the ancestor
of the Erskines of Scotscraig in Fife,
who flourished in the following century.</p></div>

this fact. Had he examined the Council
Records more carefully, he would
have found direct evidence of the practice
of proclaiming the Statutes enacted
by the Council, to which Knox alludes,
on the 8th November 1555. Knox's
account of the change of the Magistracy
of Edinburgh is quite correct, although
it has also been called in question.
Upon examining the Council Records,
it appears that Archibald Douglas was
Provost; and Mr. James Watson, David
Somer, Edward Hope, and Adam Foullarton,
Baillies, in 1560-1561; and that
on the 24th March 1560-1, proclamation
was made of the Act 1560, against
Priests, Adulterars, &amp;c. At the next
election in September 1561, Douglas was
re-elected Provost, with David Forster,
Robert Kar, Alexander Home, and Allan
Dikesoun, as Baillies. On the 2d October,
the above proclamation was ordered
to be made on the following day; and on
the 5th, the Queen sent a macer enjoining
the Town Council to deprive
their new Magistrates, and to appoint
others in their room. A new election
accordingly took place on the 8th of
October, as detailed at considerable
length by Maitland, (Hist. of Edinburgh,
p. 21.)</p></div>

of the present Government, nor the
floorishing of Religion, so that sometymes
speiches would eschape her which
bewrayed her disposition and inclination

before to commit thamselfs to the trust

a guard of hyred souldiours, bot could
find no pretext, saving onlie the custome
of forraigne Kings, and the shaw
of magnificence. Shee consulted with
hir bastard brother John, an ambitious
man, bot not so grave and austere as
Lord James. He resolved to obey hir
in all things, and therfor wes the more
deare to hir, being desirous to confound
all things. She consulteth with him
how to get a companie of hyred souldiers
about her. Ther was a tumult or
sturr famed as though the Erle of Arrane
had enclosed the Palace of Halyrudehous
round about, and by force wold
cary the Quene to his Castell fourtene
myles from thence. This invention had
some likliehood becaus of the immoderate
love he bare unto hir, and of her
affection estranged from him; both
which war not unknowin to the people.
The fray was so great that the Toune
of Edinburgh wes called to watch. Robert
Lord Halyrudhous, and John Lord
Coldingham keeped watch by course;
skouts wer sent furth, and sentrinells,
and wer commanded under the pane of
death to keep their stations. They
feared wher ther was no feare. After
the souldiers had skoured the fields all
night, they shew themselfs before the

others jesting at the sport. Bot the
authors of this invention, howbeit they

Regent, Wood became his Secretary,
and was employed in the proceedings
against Queen Mary, at York, in 1568,
as related by Sir James Melville, who
styles him "a great ringleader." In
September 1568, the Treasurer furnished
Mr. John Wood fyne black velvet, and
black satin, for a dress. The Regent, it
is well known, was assassinated in
January 1570, and Bishop Lesley in his
Negotiations says, "That within a few
days after his man Mr. John Wood, was
killed in Fife, by the Laird of Rires."
The cause of this murder is nowhere
stated, but it took place on the 15th of
April, by Arthur Forbes of Reres, (in
the parish of Kilconquhar,) assisted by
his son Arthur, and Henry Forrest; for
which the latter were denounced rebels,
6th February 1572-3. (Pitcairn's Criminal
Trials, vol. i. p. 40.) From the
Treasurer's Accounts we learn that on
the 23d September 1570, "the Laird of
Reres was at the horne, (that is, denounced
as rebel,) for the slauchter of
umquhile Maister Johne Wood."</p></div>

was long applied to designate the
mountain pass in the Highlands, in
reaching the North of Scotland. In
David Buchanan's editions of Knox's
History, where the word occurs it is
rendered "on this side of the Water,"
or, "beyond the Water," a rather
vague description. The pass or road
referred to led from Fettercairn (in
Kincardineshire) to Banchory, on the
north side of the Dee (in Aberdeenshire;)
but here it may be considered
to denote the mountain range itself,
usually called the Grampian Mountains,
which extend across the Island from
Aberdeenshire in the north-east to the

Justice Clerk, was an early and active
supporter of the Reformation. At the
Parliament in August 1560, he was one
of the number selected for the government
of the State; and some time after
Queen Mary's arrival in Scotland, he
was appointed Comptroller, in which
office he was succeeded by Sir William
Murray of Tullibardine, in 1563-4. Upon
occasion of the marriage of Lord James,
Earl of Murray, (see notes to page

who had the honour of Knighthood
conferred. He was advanced to be an
Extraordinary Lord of Session, 19th November
1567, and accompanied the Regent
Murray to York in the following
year. He died 25th September 1576.</p></div>

rang at the ring, six against six, <i>disguised

and on the 3d of June, when the Castle

Archbishop and Duke of Rheims, was
the second son of Claude Duke de Guise.
He was born 17th February 1524. He
obtained the See of Rheims in 1538, and
was consecrated in 1545, when twenty-one
years of age. We need not refer to
Protestant writers for his character, or
to the work entitled the Legend of his
Life, as it is admitted that to avarice
and inordinate pride, he joined cruelty,
want of faith, and licentiousness. Brantome
admits that the Cardinal was no
ornament to the Church, when he says,
"qui, quoique mauvais Chrétien, etait,
pour le temps, tres-bon Catholique."
He died 24th December 1574, aged 49.
</p><p>
In addition to note 4, page 267, it
may be noticed that Calderwood says,
when the Queen was preparing to return
to Scotland, "In the meanetyme, Charles
Cardinal of Lorraine, counselled her to
leave beside him her apparell and
household stuffe, till it was seene what
was the successe of her voyage. She
being acquainted with his nature, answered,
she could not see wherefore
she should be more carefull of her stuffe
and apparell nor of her owne persone."

As noticed in a previous note (page 269,)
the extreme profligacy that prevailed at

an illegitimate son of James the
Fifth, by Elizabeth, daughter of John Lord
Carmichael. His sister became the first
wife of Archibald fifth Earl of Argyle.
Randolph in a letter to Cecil, 24th
October 1561, mentioning the leading
persons at Court, says, "The Lord John
of Coldingham hath not least favour
with his leaping and dancing: he is like
to marry the Lord Bothwell's sister."
His marriage with Jean only daughter
of Patrick third Earl of Bothwell, was

Randolph in the letter referred to in

Jane Kennedy, eldest daughter of Gilbert
third Earl of Cassilis. In another
letter, 27th December 1561, he says,&mdash;"The
Lord Robert was married on
Sunday was eight days to the Earl of
Cassillis sister; and my Lord John
upon Sunday next to the Earl of Bothwell's
sister: I mean not here, in the
Court, but where the women are in

his first wife, Elizabeth Adamson. Baron
for several years filled the office of
one of the magistrates of Edinburgh,
and was returned as one of the Commissioners
to the General Assembly, from
1560 till the year of his death, which
took place in September 1569. His
will was made at Kynnaird in Fyfe,
21st September 1569, having married
for his second wife Helen Leslie, "gud-wyf
of Kynnarde," by whom he left
several daughters. (Register of Conf.
Test.) This lady, who survived him,
appears to have married again, first to
Mr. James Kirkaldy, brother of Sir
William Kirkaldy of Grange, by whom
she had a son and a daughter; and
after his death in 1573, (see page 315,

In the confirmation of her own Testament,
mention is made of her two children by her second husband; and she is
described as now spousit to Mr. James
Beaton, parson of Old Roxburgh. She
died in June 1577. (Register of Confirmed

Baroun paid a composition, as son and

transcriber of MS. L 4, has added,
"Thus farr Mr. Knox in the Fourth
Booke of his Historie. Let the Reader
compare this relation with Buchanan's,
and follow his own judgement." In
like manner Calderwood (Hist. vol. ii.
p. 177,) says, "Thus I have related this
part of the Historie, as Knox hath sett
it down in the Fourth Booke of his Historie.
Mr. Buchanan, his relation, is
somewhat different. He writeth," &amp;c.
Instead of quoting this passage, the
reader may be referred to Buchanan's
own work, in which he ascribes a plot
to murther the Earl of Murray, as
having been devised by the Earl of Bothwell,
upon finding that he would not
join Bothwell in his first design against
the Hamiltons.</p></div>

and residence in Fife, to Edinburgh,
early in May. Knox probably confounded
this absence from Edinburgh,
with the Queen's more protracted progress
in the North in Autumn, (see
page 381,) which may account for his
mistaking the precise time of his second
communing with the Queen, which
actually took place in December: see
next page, note 2.</p></div>

The report hereof being brought
unto her ears, <i>yesterday she sent for him</i>.
She talked long time with him: little
liking there was between them, of the

that the interview occurred on the 15th

St. Leonard's College, St. Andrews,
having taken his Bachelor's degree in
1555; and he became a licentiate or
Master of Arts in 1557. At the Reformation
he appears to have occasionally
exercised himself in the office of the
ministry, without being appointed to
any particular church. The want of
efficient preachers to supply the vacant
charges rendered the General Assembly
more anxious to secure the services of
qualified persons. On the 2d July 1562,
the Assembly "finding him able to
preach the word and minister the sacraments,
as he had done before times,
charged him to re-enter to the ministry,
the place where he should minister
being reserved to farther deliberation."
And on the 4th July, "It was concludit
that Mr. John Scharp should
re-enter in the ministrie, and to serve
in the kirk whilk the Superintendent of
Lothian should appoint; and if he refused,
that the censures of the Kirk be
execute against him." Scharp, however,
according to the above marginal
note, became an Advocate, and long
practised at the bar with great success.
Mr. John Scharp, Advocate, had
a charter of the lands of Houston, in the
shires of Edinburgh and Linlithgow,
25th March 1576. His name occurs in
an Act of Parliament, in July 1604, as
"Maister John Scharp of Houston,
Lawer." (Acta Parl. Scot. vol. iii. p.
264.) He was one of five persons connected
with Scotland who were knighted
by King James at Whitehall, on the
17th December 1604.</p></div>

337, Knox has mistaken the time when
the General Assembly met, and in this
way he probably committed the mistake
of saying, "Schort after," instead of
"Short before the Conventioun." The
meetings of the Assembly were from
Monday the 29th June, till Saturday the
4th July 1562. The above conflict took
place on Saturday the 27th June. The
Magistrates having apprehended and
imprisoned Gordon of Finlater, and ordered
two of the Ogilvies to be kept in
ward, they sent a messenger to the
Queen, who was then in Stirling, to obtain
her instructions. The Queen's letter,
dated penult of June, is preserved in
the Council Register, and is printed by
Keith. (Hist. vol. ii. p. 156.) But Sir
John Gordon, as Knox mentions, soon
afterwards made his escape to the
North.</p></div>

George fourth Earl of Huntley. Alexander
Ogilvy of Ogilvy, in 1545, having
disinherited his son James Ogilvy of
Cardell, settled his estates of Finlater
and Deskford upon John Gordon, who
assumed the name of Ogilvie, which was
the occasion of the animosity that existed
between the two families. James
Ogilvy of Cardell had been in France,
and was Master of the Household of
Queen Mary. He was now endeavouring
to recover possession of his father's
estates. The claim between the rival
families of Gordon and Ogilvy having
at length been referred to arbitration,
the estates of Deskford and Finlater,
in 1566, were affirmed to James Ogilvy,
the ancestor of the Earls of Finlater;
and this award was ratified in Parliament,
19th April 1567.</p></div>

became a favourite of King James the
Fifth, with whom he had been educated.
He was admitted a Privy Councillor in
1535, and was constituted Lieutenant-General
of the North in 1540. In 1546
he succeeded Cardinal Beaton as Lord
Chancellor. He obtained in 1549 a
grant of the Earldom of Murray, but
this he was forced to resign in 1559.
The estates and dignities of Mar and
Murray having afterwards been conferred
upon Lord James Stewart, this
served to encrease those fatal dissensions
which ultimately led to the Earl's death,
at Corrichie, on the 28th October 1562.</p></div>

Queen's progress in the North of Scotland.
She set out from Edinburgh, on
horseback, on the 11th August 1562,
dined that day at Calder, and then
reached the Palace of Linlithgow. Next
day, after dinner, at Lord Livingstone's,
in Callander House, she came to Stirling
Castle, where she remained till the
18th. She proceeded to Aberdeen,
where she arrived on the 27th, and remained
till the 1st of September. Having
changed her purpose of visiting the
Earl of Huntley, she proceeded, stopping
at places not so well prepared for her
reception, passed the Spey, and reached
Elgin on the 4th. On the 8th she passed
forward to Kinloss Abbey; on the
following day to Tarnaway Castle, the
chief mansion of the Earldom of Murray,
where a Privy Council was held on
the 10th of September; and Lord James
Stewart having resigned the title of
Mar, produced his patent, and assumed
the title of Murray. Next day the Queen
reached Inverness. On the 15th she
set out on her return, stopping at Tarnaway
and Spynie Castle, recrossed the
Spey at Fochabers, and reached Aberdeen
on the 22d, where the inhabitants
shewed their loyalty on occasion of her
public entry. Here she remained till
the 5th of November, during which time
the fatal conflict at Corrichie took place,
ensuring the triumph of Murray, and
the ruin of Huntley, which Chalmers
and other writers assert was the chief
object in inducing the Queen to undertake
this journey. In her return she
passed through Dunottar, Montrose,
Dundee, Perth, and arrived at Holyrood
on the evening of the 21st of November,
after more than three months'
absence. See Chalmers's Life of Queen
Mary, vol. i. sect. iv.</p></div>

he died in 1588, aged seventy. He was

who died in 1553, without issue.
Alexander married Lady Margaret, the
second daughter, and George, Lady Anne,
the third daughter of the Duke of Chattelherault.
On his father's death at Corrichie,
George became fifth Earl of Huntley.
But being apprehended, he was convicted

sentenced to be executed. The
latter part of the sentence however
being delayed, he was sent to Dunbar
Castle, where he remained a prisoner

In May 1555, "Robert Melville, servand

and in September following, £75, as his
pension for the Whitsunday term, that
year. He had long resided at the Court
of France, during the reign of Henry
the Second; and was afterwards much
employed in public affairs. He was
knighted in 1582, and was raised to the
Peerage, by the title of Lord Melville
of Monimail, in 1616, having survived
till 1621, when he died at the very advanced
age of 94.</p></div>

known, having adhered to the Queen's
party, he remained in the Castle of
Edinburgh during the whole time of the
siege by the English troops in 1573,
until its surrender, under promise that
the Governor and his associates should be
favourably treated. But Queen Elizabeth
delivered them up to their implacable
enemy the Regent Morton; and Lethington
was with Kirkaldy of Grange, and
the other prisoners, carried to Leith; but
whether it was his own act, to save the
disgrace of a public execution, or that of
others, he died, "not without suspicion
of poison," on the 9th June 1573.</p></div>

Paul Methven as an active and zealous
preacher, (vol. i. p. 300.) The proceedings
against him by order of the Assembly,
contained in the Book of the
Kirk, consist of extracts from Calderwood.
Knox was appointed on the
30th December 1562, to proceed to Jedburgh,
and on the 3d of January to
take trial of the slander raised against
Methven. At the next General Assembly,
on the 25th June 1563, Knox reported
that Methven had been removed
from his charge, and excommunicated.</p></div>

in MS. L 4, is introduced with a passage
relating to "Danvill, son to Annas
Montmorrencie, Constable of France,"
who had accompanied "the Guises to
Scotland;" but the reference, "as
Thuanus sayeth," clearly shews it to
be a subsequent interpolation. "When
he (Danvill) departed, he left behind
him Monsieur Chattellet, nephew to the
famous knyght Pierr Tertall, by his
daughter. Whill he is left a brocker
between Danvill and the Queen, he lauboured
to conquist hir affection to himself.
He passed all others in credit," &amp;c.
See Cald. Hist. vol. ii. p. 211. It may
be added, in reference to this MS. L 4,
that it corresponds very closely with the
MS. portion of Mr. M'Crie's copy of Vautrollier's
edition; and the latter was
probably the copy that Calderwood the
Historian made use of, as his extracts
correspond with it, and the MS. additions
resemble the handwriting of his

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_870_870" id="Footnote_870_870"></a><a href="#FNanchor_870_870"><span class="label">[870]</span></a> The name of Chastelard, among
other varieties by different writers, occurs
as Chatelar, Chastellet, Charterlet,
Chatillon. But we cannot well identify
him with a person of nearly the same
name who had been attached to the
household of the Queen Regent in 1555,
as appears from this entry in the Treasurer's
Accounts, on the 7th January:&mdash;"Item,
Given to <i>Franschois Chattillihon</i>,
kepar of the Quenis Grace chalmer dur,

his departing to Fransche&mdash;1 lb." (£50.)
</p><p>
Chastelard arrived in Scotland in
1561, as one of the suite of M. de Damville.
He returned with him to France;
but in November 1562, he again visited
Scotland as the bearer of letters to the
Queen. He remained about the Court
until the 12th of February 1562-3, the
night when he concealed himself in the
Queen's bed-chamber in the Palace of
Holyrood. He followed her to Fife, and
two days later, he was discovered, as
Knox relates, at Burntisland, and being
arrested, he was conveyed and tried at
St. Andrews, where he was executed on
the 22d February 1562-3. No account of
his trial has been preserved, the scroll
Court-book of Justiciary, from May
1562 to May 1563, being lost. (Pitcairn's
Criminal Trials, vol. i. p. 427.)</p></div>

account of Chastelard, and says, he was
a gentleman of Dauphinè, and grand-nephew
on the mother's side of the celebrated
M. de Bayard. On the day of
his execution, he says, when brought
to the scaffold, he took into his hands
the hymns of the French poet Ronsard,
"et, pour son éternelle consolation,
se mit à lire tout entiérement
l'hymne de la mort, <i>qui est tres-bien fait,
et propre pour ne point abhorrer la
mort</i>; ne s'aydent autrement d'autre
livre spirituel, ny de Ministre, ny de
Confesseur." He then adds that Chastelard
turned to the place where he
supposed the Queen to be, and cried
aloud,&mdash;"Adieu, the most beautiful and
the most cruel Princess of the world."
(Oeuvres, tome ii. p. 357.) Randolph,
however, says, "he died with repentance."

severity on Knox's language in thus attributing
this dearth and high price of
provisions "as an immediate punishment
upon what he calls 'the idolatry
of our wicked rulers.'" (Hist. vol. ii.
p. 193.) He also quotes an Act of
Privy Council, 11th February 1562-3,
against eating flesh during the season of
Lent, because, as the Act bears, "The
cattle had suffered much by the tempestuous
storms of the winter bypast."</p></div>

Keith has printed from what he calls
"the Shattered MS.," the "Instructions

Mr. William Maitland, younger of Lethingtoun."
(Hist. vol. ii. p. 188.) They
have reference, however, to his mission

"the Bishop of Caithness." The titular
Archbishop of Athens, Alexander
Gordon, afterwards Bishop of Galloway,
&amp;c., (see page 259, note 10,) was undoubtedly
the person alluded to.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_885_885" id="Footnote_885_885"></a><a href="#FNanchor_885_885"><span class="label">[885]</span></a> In the proceedings of the General
Assemblies, held between June 1562 and
August 1575, (or less than three months
of his death,) Bishop Gordon's name
frequently occurs. Having petitioned
the Assembly in June 1562, it was declared,
the Assembly "cannot acknowledge
him for a Superintendent lawfully
called for the present, but offered
unto him their aid and assistance, if the
Kirks of Galloway shall suit (solicit),
and the Lords present;" and enjoins
him to subscribe the Book of Discipline,
(although he seems actually to have
done so in 1561: see page 258.) On the
29th December 1562, the Assembly nominated
for that office, "Mr. Alexander
Gordon, entituled Bishop of Galloway,
and Mr. Robert Post, minister of Dunkell;"
and ordered the inauguration of
the person elected to take place in the
Parish Kirk of Dumfries, "on the last
Lord's day of April." The election, as
Knox intimates, did not take place.
But Gordon was continued as Commissioner
for planting and visiting the
churches of that diocese; although there
were frequent complaints made against
him.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_886_886" id="Footnote_886_886"></a><a href="#FNanchor_886_886"><span class="label">[886]</span></a> Lady Jane Stewart, a natural
daughter of King James the Fifth, and
Elizabeth, daughter of John Lord Carmichael.
Her marriage with Archibald
fifth Earl of Argyle took place in April
1554, and proved unfortunate for both
parties; but no separation ensued till
about the year 1564. She received from
her sister, Queen Mary, a pension of
£150, in June 1565. She was one of the
party at supper in Holyrood Palace the
night of Riccio's murder, 9th March
1566. She stood sponsor for Queen Elizabeth
at the baptism of James the
Sixth. In 1567, (15th November,) the
Treasurer paid "to Dame Janet Stewart,
Comptis of Ergile," £133, 6s. 8d.
The action of Divorce founded upon the
complaints of both parties, led to a
lengthened litigation, of which Mr. Riddell
has furnished a detailed account in
his most valuable work on Peerage and
Consistorial Law, vol. i. pp. 547-551. In
1569, the Earl offered to adhere, and to
receive her in his Castle of Dunoon, but
the Lady now refused. At length the
Earl, on the 23d June 1573, "obtained,
(says Mr. Riddell,) a decree of divorce,
<i>simpliciter</i>, by the Commissaries of Edinburgh,
adjudging her to have 'lost her
tocher <i>ad donationis propter nuptias</i>."'
The Earl immediately availed himself of
this judgment, by forming an alliance
with Lady Jane Cunningham, daughter
of Alexander Earl of Glencairn, in the
month of August. Having died within a
month of his second marriage, 12th September
1573, (see page 258;) his first
wife soon afterwards raised an action
of Reduction of the Divorce, styling
Lady Jane Cunningham, as "pretendit
spous of umquhil Archibald Erle of
Argyle." She died in the Canongate, 7th
January 1586-7, and was interred in
the Royal Vault in the Abbey of Holyrood
House. Her own settlement became
the subject of litigation. (Commissary

place on the 26th May 1563. Randolph,
on the 3d June, writes thus to
Cecil: "The Parliament began 26th
May, on which day the Queen came to
it in her robes, and crowned; the Duke
carrying the crown, Argill the scepter,
and Murray the sword. She made in
English an oration publiquely there,
and was present at the condemnation
of the two Earles, Huntley and Sutherland."
In like manner, the Diurnal of

the body of a person deceased, when
accused of treason, was brought into
Court. It will be seen from the note at
page 359, that Huntley's body, in the
view of carrying through his forfeiture,
had been brought to Edinburgh in December
1562. And, "Upoun the xxviij

"The Persone of Dundrennan,"
but this is deleted, and "Proveist of
Lyncluden, Douglas of Drumlanrig by
name," inserted. In the MS. the name
Lyncluden appears as if written Glyncluden;
and this form of the name is
retained in the later MSS., adding an
additional blunder, by writing, "N.
Douglas <i>of Lanerk</i> by surname, &amp;c."&mdash;Lincluden
was a Priory or Convent of
Black Nuns, situated upon the water of
Cluden a few miles above Dumfries;
but owing to their scandalous lives, the
Priory had been changed by the Earl of
Douglas, in the reign of Robert the
Third, into a College or Provostry.
(Keith's Catalogue, pp. 459, 470.)
</p><p>
According to the peerage writers, Mr.
Robert Douglas, Provost of Lincluden,
(from whom the Douglasses of Burford
are descended,) was the second son of
Sir William Douglas of Drumlanrig, who
was killed at Floddon in 1513. But
Chalmers has shown, that he was the
natural son of Sir James Douglas of
Drumlanrig, who succeeded to the
estates in 1513, and died in 1578. Mr.
Robert Douglas obtained letters of legitimation,
8th October 1559, being twelve
years after his appointment as Provost
of Lincluden, 16th September 1547.
(Caledonia, vol. iii. p. 309.) In December
1585, Mr. Robert Douglas still retained
his title as Provost of Lincluden,
and the fruits of the benefice, when a
gift of the Provostrie was ratified by an
Act of Parliament in favour of William
Douglas, lawful son to &mdash;&mdash; Douglas of
Drumlanrig. (Acta Parl. Scot. vol. iii.
pp. 415, 436.) About the same time he
was appointed Collector General and
Treasurer of the New Augmentations:
he is so styled in deeds and Parliamentary
proceedings between 1587 and 1594.
William Douglas of Lincluden and
Grenelaw, "the eldest son and apparent
heir of William Douglas of Baitford,"
was tried and executed at Edinburgh in
September 1610. (Pitcairn's Criminal
Trials, vol. iii. p. 90.)</p></div>

expresses this same feeling in regard to
the Queen's progress, when he says,
"the carrying of the Mass through

Madame Raylie was the wife of
Mons. Raullet or Roullet, the Queen's
private Secretary. The disturbance
which is here alluded to, happened on
Sunday the 15th of August 1563. Roullet
is frequently mentioned in Queen
Mary's correspondence. He was sent
to Flanders with letters of credit from
the Queen, addressed to the Cardinal de
Granville, in January 1564-5. (Labanoff,
Recueil, &amp;c., vol. i. pp. 197-206,
vol. vii. p. 291.) He died 30th August
1574, as the Queen informs Beaton,
Archbishop of Glasgow, in a letter dated
Sheffield, 4th September, (ib. vol. iv. p.
216.) The Earl of Shrewsbury took
this occasion to search his coffers in the
hope of discovering letters or papers
that might implicate his Royal Mistress,
the unfortunate Queen of Scots. (Chalmers's
Life, &amp;c., vol. ii. p. 68.) In 1586,
in the list of the Queen's attendants,
one of the "gentlewomen of her chamber,"
was Renee Rallay <i>alias</i> Beauregard.

of Straegthrow, in Forfarshire, 20th

an Act of Pacification in his favour. (vol.

the Trinity Order in Scotland. From
being the head of the Order, he appears
to have had a seat in Parliament." (Caledonia,

Cunningham, a natural son of William
Earl of Glencairn, at the age of
twenty-two, was appointed <i>Minister</i>;
and he sat in Parliament among the
clergy in 1546; and also in 1560. "William

Abbot of Kilwynning in 1541, Dean of
Glasgow in 1550, and President of the
Court of Session in 1559. The Queen
Regent, on the 27th March 1560, had
written in his favour, to be advanced to
the See of Ross, then vacant, by the
death of David Panter, as mentioned by
the French envoys De la Brosse and
the Bishop of Amiens, in their letter of
that date, to the Cardinal de Lorraine,
and the Duko de Guise:&mdash;"La Royne

a speciall enemy to Mr. Knox, becaus
he still affirmed, that a Bishop receiving
profite, and not feeding the flock by his
owne labours, is a theefe and a murtherer."
(Hist. vol. ii. p. 233.) Knox
employs no measured terms in also
speaking of his brother John Sinclair,
who became Bishop of Brechin, and his
successor as President, "as ane perfyte
hypocrite," (vol. i. pp. 265.) Queen
Mary, on the 20th February 1563-4,
applied to Queen Elizabeth for a safe
conduct "unto our traist Counsalour.
Henry Bischop of Ross, (quhom we haif

for a safe conduct to "oure weil belovit
Clerk, Maister Johne Sinclair, Dene of
Restalrig, being in the partes of France,
and willing to returne hamewart in this

to the disease of which the Bishop
of Ross died, at Paris, on the 2d January
1564-5. (Diurnal of Occurrents, pp.

note, (vol. i. p 319,) it will be seen that
Sir John Maxwell, whose name occurs
repeatedly in Knox, married the eldest
daughter and co-heiress of Lord Herries
of Terreglis. Sometimes he is styled
the Master of Maxwell, as presumptive
heir of the title. He was much employed
in public affairs, and was long
Warden of the West Marches. Having
joined himself with the Lords of the Congregation,
on the 2d February 1559-60,
he was one of the ambassadors sent by
them to England. He was generally
known as Sir John Maxwell of Terreglis;
and this barony, in 1566, was
erected into a Lordship, and Sir John
took his seat in the Parliament 1567, as
Lord Herries. In the latter period of
his life, he became one of the most constant
and zealous adherents of Queen
Mary.</p></div>

Various minute corrections, chiefly in

of Chester, born about the year 1520,
and educated at Oxford. During the
persecutions in England, after Queen
Mary's accession to the throne, he went
first to Frankfort, then to Strasburg,
and in September 1555, he was chosen
Knox's colleague at Geneva. In 1558,
he published his celebrated treatise,
"How Superior Powers ought to be
obeyed," which rendered him so obnoxious
to Queen Elizabeth, on account
of his statements on "The Regiment of
Women." Finding no encouragement,
on returning to England, he accompanied
Knox's wife and family to Scotland,
in September 1559, and became
minister of Ayr. He was soon afterwards
translated to St. Andrews, as a
place of greater importance. He returned
to England towards the close of
1565. (Booke of the Kirk, vol. i. p. 72.)
He died at an advanced age, at Chester,
in 1601. See notices collected by Dr.
M'Crie, Life of Knox, vol. ii. pp. 331-333,

third Lord Sempill, by a second marriage
with Elizabeth Carlyle. (Wood's
Peerage, vol. ii. p. 494.) Mary Levingstone
was one of the Queen's Maries
who accompanied her to France, and
was the youngest daughter of Alexander
fifth Lord Levingstone. It may
have been to ensure their marriage that
the Queen, by a special grant under the
Privy Seal, to "John Sempill, sone to hir
cousin Robert Lord Sempill, and Marie
Levingstoun his spous, sister to William
Lord Livingstone," granted a charter of
various lands, in consideration that "it
had pleisit God to move thair hartis to
joyne togidder in the stait of matrimonye."
It is dated 9th March 1564-5.
In the Parliament 19th April 1567, when
it proposed to annul the forfeiture of
George Earl of Huntley, which would
affect various grants that had been
made, the charter of infestment in the
lands of Auchtermuchty, Stewarton, and
others, to Sempill, was anew ratified by
the Queen. (Acta Parl. Scot., vol. ii. p.
559.) The same favour was continued
by James the Sixth, on the penult
November 1581, from his general Revocation
of grants, among other exceptions,
"reservit and exceptit" the infestment
made by Queen Mary "to
umquhile John Semple of Butress, and
Marie Livingston his spous, of the
town and lands of Auchtermuchtie, and
otheris," &amp;c. (ib. vol. iii. p. 245.) This
shews that Semple was then deceased.
He had acquired the lands of Beltrees in
Renfrewshire&mdash;a name distinguished in
the literature of Scotland during the
17th century.</p></div>

alludes are not known to be preserved.
Various enactments and proclamations
were made from time to time, prohibiting,
in 1556, for instance, "the odeous

be seen from the previous note 3, that
the lands of Auchtermuchty, in Fife, had
been conferred on John Sempill and
Mary Levingstone, his wife, in 1565.
The Lordship of Abercorn was probably
bestowed about the same time upon
one of the courtiers. At a later period,
at least, John Levingstone, one of the
Master Stabularis, had a grant in feu-farm
of the lands, &amp;c., of Abercorn, 10th
October 1587, of which he obtained a
ratification by Parliament, 5th June
1592. (Acta Parl. Scot., vol. iii. p. 643.)</p></div>

The person referred to was Jacques Lusgerie,
who had been the Queen's physician
while she resided in France. He
is mentioned by her in a letter to Catharine
de Medicis, 12th March 1565. In
May 1571, the Queen requests Beaton
to send her a physician from France,
with the advice, or recommended by
Lusgerie. (Labanoff, Lettres, &amp;c., vol. i.

in the North, she had visited the West of
Scotland, and returned from Inverary
through Ayrshire to Dumfries. This
journey lasted from the 29th June till
the beginning of September 1563. After
stopping a few days in Edinburgh, she
proceeded to Perthshire and Stirling.
But the journey to which Knox here alludes
was in the following year. She
rode from Edinburgh on the 22d of July
1564. She was at Perth on the 31st,
when she went into the district of
Athole "to the hunting." After crossing
the mountains, and visiting some
parts of Inverness-shire, and the Chanonry
of Ross, she returned along the
east coast, by Aberdeen and Dunottar,
to Dundee and St. Andrews, reaching
Holyrood on the 25th or 26th September,
after an absence of upwards of two
months.</p></div>

a brief notice of Douglas is given, in
order to show that he must be distinguished
from John Douglas, a Carmalite
Friar, who, forsaking his order,
became in 1558, Chaplain to the Earl of
Argyle. As stated in the note referred
to, Mr. John Douglas was elected Provost
of St. Mary's College, St. Andrews,
in 1547. He was also elected for a long
series of years Rector of the University;
and having embraced the Reformed
opinions, he still continued his residence
at St. Andrews, retaining his situation
as Provost of the College. In 1571,
when "an auld feeble man," by "compromise
with the Earl of Morton, he was
nominated to the See of St. Andrews:
Knox having refused to inaugurate him,
the ceremony was performed by Mr.
John Wynrame. (M'Crie's Life of Knox.)
According to his Confirmed Testament,
29th January 1574-5, "Johne Archbishop
of Sanctandrois, &amp;c. died in
(blank) 1574;" and it shows that his
nominal dignity had not enriched him.
The Summa of his Inventar amounted
only to £280, 4s. 4d., and this included
"Item, his L[ordship's] liberall [library]
of bukis, extending to ane hundreth

Scotland. He was minister of the Canongate
for a short time, before he was

Laird of Lethington, was the eldest son of
Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington, and
was born probably between 1525 and
1530. He is said to have studied at St.
Andrews, but his name does not occur
in the Registers as having taken any
degree. Chalmers has devoted much labour
in tracing the career of this very
able man, whose policy in changing his
views from time to time proved equally
unfortunate to himself and his country.
(Life of Mary Queen of Scots, 2d edit.
vol. iii. page 530 to 615.) At an early
period of life Maitland took an active
share in public affairs. Knox mentions
him under the year 1555, (vol. i. p. 247;)
and on more than one occasion calls
him "the author of all the mischief"
that had occurred. He first appears in
the service of the Queen Regent; and in
September 1555, the Treasurer paid "to
William Maitland, be the Quenis Grace
precept, for his pension of this instant
zeir, £150." After the death of Bishop
Panter, on the 4th December 1558, he
was appointed Secretary of State. In
October 1559, he joined the Lords of the
Congregation; in August 1560, he acted
as Speaker of Parliament; and in the
following year he was raised to the
bench. After various embassies to
France and England, and after having
an active share in all the intrigues and
public affairs of the time, he died at
Leith, as alluded to at page 363, note I,
9th June 1573. He was twice married.
On the 10th November 1552, he had a
charter of lands in Stirlingshire to himself
and Janet Menteith his spouse: she
was the daughter of Menteith of Kerse.
He married, secondly, at Stirling, 6th
January 1566-7, Mary Fleming, daughter
of Malcolm third Lord Fleming.
After his death she addressed a pathetic
letter to Lord Burleigh, dated from Edinburgh,
21st June 1573, praying that her
husband's body might "<i>receive no shame
or ignominy</i>." The English General,
on the 18th, had also written, that he
had been pressed by the Earl of Athole
and others, "that the body of Ledingtoun
might be buried, <i>and not remain
above the ground as it does</i>."&mdash;In 1584,
Parliament passed an Act of "Pacification
to Marie Flemyng, (relict of
umquhill William Maitland younger of
Lethingtoun, Secretare to our Soverane
Lord) and his bairnis." (Acta Parl.
Scot. vol. iii. p. 313.)</p></div>

L 1, we read as follows: "In this Conference,

a proofe of Mr. Knox his deep jugement
and promptness in citing the passages
of Scripture, besides his great zeal,
courage, and sinceritie in the cause of
God, without respect to flesh or blood."
MS. L 4, adds, "Mr. Knox endeth the

In MS. M, "Heere endeth the
Fourth Booke of Mr. Knox his Historie
of the Church of Scotland." On a separate
leaf in MS. L 4, are four paragraphs
which occur in Book Fifth, and
are copied nearly <i>verbatim</i> in Calderwood's

evident error in the date for the 23d,) we
read, "Lennox restored by Parliament

the reason of restoring Lennox; and
the rather, because it was at the request

the Queene to observe what things were

not good that the Articles should be
propounded after this manner, but drew
out two heads; First, they would declare
the good mind and obedience of
the Assembly; Next, they would labour
at her G[race's] hands for settling of
Religion according to the order established
before her arrivall. They promised
also to deal with her for set stipends.
Lethington returned a gracious
answer to these Heads. It was appointed

of Angus and Mearnes, was

Paul Methven's supplication anent his

and considered. The Brethren were
content to receive him, providing he presented himself personally before them,
and shew evident signes of unfained repentance,
and willingness to obey such
a forme of repentance as they should
enjoyne. As for deleting the processe
out of their Books, they could no wayes
condescend, neither thought they such
a Petition could proceed of the Holy
Spirit, seeing David, a notable servant
of God, was not ashamed to leave in register
his offence, to God's glory and
his own confusion. Anent his admission

terminating however in an advantageous

is partly confirmed by the Council

This sum was advanced by way of loan
by 381 persons, whose names, and the
amount of their contributions, appear in

furnished by twenty-five persons, "men

received a charter of the Superiority of

April following, the Queen having repented
of this bargain, wrote to the
Magistrates of Edinburgh to delay
taking possession of the town of Leith;
but this request it stated, "they obstinately

has been retained for nearly three centuries,
to the prejudice of the one, and

Scotland, Messire Jaques d'Augennes,
Seigneur de Rembouillet, is mentioned
in Queen Mary's letters, in February
1566. (Labanoff, vol. i. pp. 319, 327.)
He arrived in Edinburgh, on Monday
the 4th February 1565-6, having come
through England with a train of thirty-six
horse. (Diurnal of Occurrents, p.
87.) The object of his mission was to
invest Henry Lord Darnley with the
Order of St. Michael, commonly called
the "Order of the Cockle;" the same
honour having previously been conferred,
at Windsor, on the Duke of
Norfolk and the Earl of Leicester. On
the 10th February, "at 12 hours befoir
none, the Kingis Majestie, (Darnley,)
accumpanyit with his Nobillis in Halyrud-hous,
ressavit the Ordour of Knycht-heid
of the Cockill fra the said Rambolat,
Ambassatour foirsaid, with great
magnificence." Various banquets were
given to the Ambassador both in the
Palace and Castle of Edinburgh; and
he took his departures on the 14th of
that month, returning through England.

As elsewhere stated, Mr. Henry Sinclair,
Rector of Glasgow, who became Bishop
of Ross, and President, died in Paris on
the 1st January 1564-5. His brother,
Mr. John Sinclair, Dean of Restalrig,
became Bishop of Brechin, and President
of the Court of Session. He died
in James Mosman's house, in Forrester's
Wynd, Edinburgh, on the 9th April
1566. (Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 98.)
Abraham Creighton, Provost of Dunglass,
and Official of Lothian, was appointed
a Judge on the 17th February
1547-8. His death took place before
the l5th November 1565; and it is quite
certain he never was President of the
Court of Session. (Haig and Brunton's
Senators, &amp;c., pp. 58, 63, 92.)</p></div>

in the Chapel-Royal of Stirling, upon

Hamilton, Archbishop of St. Andrews.
The English Ambassador, the Earl of
Bedford, and most of the Scotish Nobility,
remained without the door of the
Chapel, to avoid countenancing the ceremonies
of the Romish Church, which
were used on that occasion. The
Queen's sister, the Countess of Argyle,
assisted at the ceremony; for which,
having "willingly submittit hirself to

1567," the said Lady was ordained by

Striveling, in time of preaching. (Book

Queen's conduct in "this infamous marriage,"
even when acquitted of being in
any way accessory to Darnley's murder.
That event occurred on the 9th
February 1566-7. Bothwell, who was
denounced as his murderer, submitted
to a mock trial on the 12th April;
and on the 19th, he obtained from the
Queen in Parliament a ratification of
several lands, &amp;c., as Keeper of the
Castle of Dunbar. On the 24th of the
same month, the Queen was way-laid,
and forcibly carried off to Dunbar,
where she was coerced to agree to an
alliance with a man who was then married.
To accomplish this, Bothwell
brought the Queen to the Castle of
Edinburgh on the 29th April. He obtained
a sentence of divorce from his
first wife on the 7th May; his marriage
with the Queen was proclaimed
on the 12th of that month; and having
created him Duke of Orkney, on the
15th their marriage was celebrated.
Thus within the period of three months
all these events happened. One month
later, the Queen surrendered on Carberry-hill,
and Bothwell made his escape:
they never met after that day.</p></div>

Bishop Reid, in the See of Orkney, and
was admitted to the temporalities of the
Bishopric, 14th October 1559. He was
one of four Prelates who joined the Reformers.
In 1564 he was appointed an
Extraordinary Lord of Session; and an
Ordinary Lord, 13th November 1565.
He celebrated the marriage of Queen
Mary and Bothwell, but afterwards took
an active part in opposing him. He
also officiated at the baptism of James
the Sixth. His conduct was viewed with
suspicion by the Kirk, and various articles
were alleged against him in the
General Assembly, 25th December 1567;
but having submitted, and made a public
confession of his offence, he was restored
to his ministry. He exchanged the temporalities
of his Bishopric with Lord
Robert Stewart for the Abbey of Holyrood-House,
which was ratified by a
charter under the Great Seal, 25th September
1569. He died on the 23d August
1593, in the sixty-seventh year of
his age, according to an inscription
which still exists in the Abbey Church
of Holyrood, with some Latin verses, by
M. H. R., (Mr. Hercules Rollock.)</p></div>
